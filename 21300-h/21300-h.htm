<p>[Transcriber's notes:<br>
-Page vii: The word following "view of what Owen" was unclear,
and may not be the "Writes" which has been chosen.<br><br>

We've made every effort to match the original, except for the following
formatting changes and corrections:<br>

1. The music system layout in these pieces is sometimes odd
(e.g. bars broken off in the middle), so the system layout has been
normalized where necessary.<br>

2. Text in small-caps could not be reproduced -- all-caps has been used instead.<br>

3. Obvious musical errors in the original have been corrected, as follows:<br>

<span class="add2em">Days of Forty-Nine:</span> bar 9, beat 3, piano left hand -
corrected quarter note to dotted quarter note; bar 11, beat 1, piano left hand -
corrected bottom note from F to G.<br>

<span class="add2em">Whoopee Ti Yi Yo:</span> bar 6, beat 4, piano right hand -
corrected next-to-last chord from A-B-D (which sounds very wrong) to F-G-D
(to match chord in bar 9, beat 4); in lyrics, corrected "Its" to "It's" in bar 15.<br>

<span class="add2em">Little Joe, The Wrangler:</span> repeat barline moved to correct place at end.<br>

<span class="add2em">Prisoner for Life:</span> third to last bar, piano left hand,
bottom note corrected from C to B.<br>

<span class="add2em">The Dying Ranger:</span> in bar 4, voice part, corrected dotted
quarter to dotted eighth.<br>

<span class="add2em">Fuller and Warren:</span> in bar 14, piano right hand, the D-sharp
in the last chord was corrected to D-natural.]</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Lomax,</p>

<p>You have done a work emphatically worth doing and one which should
appeal to the people of all our country, but particularly to the
people of the west and southwest. Your subject is not only exceedingly
interesting to the student of literature, but also to the student of
the general history of the west. There is something very curious in
the reproduction here on this new continent of essentially the
conditions of ballad-growth which obtained in medi√¶val England;
including, by the way, sympathy for the outlaw, Jesse James taking the
place of Robin Hood. Under modern conditions however, the native
ballad is speedily killed by competition with the music hall songs;
the cowboys becoming ashamed to sing the crude homespun ballads in
view of what Owen Writes calls the "ill-smelling saloon cleverness"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>(p. viii)</span> of the far less interesting compositions of the music-hall
singers. It is therefore a work of real importance to preserve
permanently this unwritten ballad literature of the back country and
the frontier.</p>

<p>With all good wishes, I am</p>

<p><span class="add2em">very truly yours</span><br>

<h2>INTRODUCTION <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiv" name="pagexiv"></a>(p. xiv)</span></h2>


<p>It is now four or five years since my attention was called to the
collection of native American ballads from the Southwest, already
begun by Professor Lomax. At that time, he seemed hardly to appreciate
their full value and importance. To my colleague, Professor G.L.
Kittredge, probably the most eminent authority on folk-song in
America, this value and importance appeared as indubitable as it
appeared to me. We heartily joined in encouraging the work, as a real
contribution both to literature and to learning. The present volume is
the first published result of these efforts.</p>

<p>The value and importance of the work seems to me double. One phase of
it is perhaps too highly special ever to be popular. Whoever has begun
the inexhaustibly fascinating study of popular song and literature&mdash;of
the nameless poetry which vigorously lives through the centuries&mdash;must
be perplexed by the necessarily conjectural opinions concerning its
origin and development held by various and disputing scholars. When
songs were made in times and terms which for centuries have been not
living facts but facts of remote history or tradition, it is
impossible to be sure quite how they begun, and by quite what means
they sifted through the centuries into the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexv" name="pagexv"></a>(p. xv)</span> forms at last
securely theirs, in the final rigidity of print. In this collection of
American ballads, almost if not quite uniquely, it is possible to
trace the precise manner in which songs and cycles of song&mdash;obviously
analogous to those surviving from older and antique times&mdash;have come
into being. The facts which are still available concerning the ballads
of our own Southwest are such as should go far to prove, or to
disprove, many of the theories advanced concerning the laws of
literature as evinced in the ballads of the old world.</p>

<p>Such learned matter as this, however, is not so surely within my
province, who have made no technical study of literary origins, as is
the other consideration which made me feel, from my first knowledge of
these ballads, that they are beyond dispute valuable and important. In
the ballads of the old world, it is not historical or philological
considerations which most readers care for. It is the wonderful,
robust vividness of their artless yet supremely true utterance; it is
the natural vigor of their surgent, unsophisticated human rhythm. It
is the sense, derived one can hardly explain how, that here is
expression straight from the heart of humanity; that here is something
like the sturdy root from which the finer, though not always more
lovely, flowers of polite literature have sprung. At times when we
yearn for polite grace, ballads may seem rude; at times when polite
grace seems tedious, sophisticated, corrupt, or mendacious, their very
rudeness refreshes us <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvi" name="pagexvi"></a>(p. xvi)</span> with a new sense of brimming life. To
compare the songs collected by Professor Lomax with the immortalities
of olden time is doubtless like comparing the literature of America
with that of all Europe together. Neither he nor any of us would
pretend these verses to be of supreme power and beauty. None the less,
they seem to me, and to many who have had a glimpse of them,
sufficiently powerful, and near enough beauty, to give us some such
wholesome and enduring pleasure as comes from work of this kind proved
and acknowledged to be masterly.</p>

<p>What I mean may best be implied, perhaps, by a brief statement of
fact. Four or five years ago, Professor Lomax, at my request, read
some of these ballads to one of my classes at Harvard, then engaged in
studying the literary history of America. From that hour to the
present, the men who heard these verses, during the cheerless progress
of a course of study, have constantly spoken of them and written of
them, as of something sure to linger happily in memory. As such I
commend them to all who care for the native poetry of America.</p>

<h2>COLLECTOR'S NOTE <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvii" name="pagexvii"></a>(p. xvii)</span></h2>


<p>Out in the wild, far-away places of the big and still unpeopled
west,&mdash;in the ca√±ons along the Rocky Mountains, among the mining camps
of Nevada and Montana, and on the remote cattle ranches of Texas, New
Mexico, and Arizona,&mdash;yet survives the Anglo-Saxon ballad spirit that
was active in secluded districts in England and Scotland even after
the coming of Tennyson and Browning. This spirit is manifested both in
the preservation of the English ballad and in the creation of local
songs. Illiterate people, and people cut off from newspapers and
books, isolated and lonely,&mdash;thrown back on primal resources for
entertainment and for the expression of emotion,&mdash;utter themselves
through somewhat the same character of songs as did their forefathers
of perhaps a thousand years ago. In some such way have been made and
preserved the cowboy songs and other frontier ballads contained in
this volume. The songs represent the operation of instinct and
tradition. They are chiefly interesting to the present generation,
however, because of the light they throw on the conditions of pioneer
life, and more particularly because of the information they contain
concerning that unique and romantic figure in modern civilization, the
American cowboy.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexviii" name="pagexviii"></a>(p. xviii)</span> profession of cow-punching, not yet a lost art in a
group of big western states, reached its greatest prominence during
the first two decades succeeding the Civil War. In Texas, for example,
immense tracts of open range, covered with luxuriant grass, encouraged
the raising of cattle. One person in many instances owned thousands.
To care for the cattle during the winter season, to round them up in
the spring and mark and brand the yearlings, and later to drive from
Texas to Fort Dodge, Kansas, those ready for market, required large
forces of men. The drive from Texas to Kansas came to be known as
"going up the trail," for the cattle really made permanent, deep-cut
trails across the otherwise trackless hills and plains of the long
way. It also became the custom to take large herds of young steers
from Texas as far north as Montana, where grass at certain seasons
grew more luxuriant than in the south. Texas was the best breeding
ground, while the climate and grass of Montana developed young cattle
for the market.</p>

<p>A trip up the trail made a distinct break in the monotonous life of
the big ranches, often situated hundreds of miles from where the
conventions of society were observed. The ranch community consisted
usually of the boss, the straw-boss, the cowboys proper, the horse
wrangler, and the cook&mdash;often a negro. These men lived on terms of
practical equality. Except in the case of the boss, there was little
difference in the amounts paid each for his services. <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexix" name="pagexix"></a>(p. xix)</span>
Society, then, was here reduced to its lowest terms. The work of the
men, their daily experiences, their thoughts, their interests, were
all in common. Such a community had necessarily to turn to itself for
entertainment. Songs sprang up naturally, some of them tender and
familiar lays of childhood, others original compositions, all genuine,
however crude and unpolished. Whatever the most gifted man could
produce must bear the criticism of the entire camp, and agree with the
ideas of a group of men. In this sense, therefore, any song that came
from such a group would be the joint product of a number of them,
telling perhaps the story of some stampede they had all fought to
turn, some crime in which they had all shared equally, some comrade's
tragic death which they had all witnessed. The song-making did not
cease as the men went up the trail. Indeed the songs were here
utilized for very practical ends. Not only were sharp, rhythmic
yells&mdash;sometimes beaten into verse&mdash;employed to stir up lagging
cattle, but also during the long watches the night-guards, as they
rode round and round the herd, improvised cattle lullabies which
quieted the animals and soothed them to sleep. Some of the best of the
so-called "dogie songs" seem to have been created for the purpose of
preventing cattle stampedes,&mdash;such songs coming straight from the
heart of the cowboy, speaking familiarly to his herd in the stillness
of the night.</p>

<p>The long drives up the trail occupied months, and called <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexx" name="pagexx"></a>(p. xx)</span> for
sleepless vigilance and tireless activity both day and night. When at
last a shipping point was reached, the cattle marketed or loaded on
the cars, the cowboys were paid off. It is not surprising that the
consequent relaxation led to reckless deeds. The music, the dancing,
the click of the roulette ball in the saloons, invited; the lure of
crimson lights was irresistible. Drunken orgies, reactions from months
of toil, deprivation, and loneliness on the ranch and on the trail,
brought to death many a temporarily crazed buckaroo. To match this
dare-deviltry, a saloon man in one frontier town, as a sign for his
business, with psychological ingenuity painted across the broad front
of his building in big black letters this challenge to God, man, and
the devil: <i>The Road to Ruin</i>. Down this road, with swift and eager
footsteps, has trod many a pioneer viking of the West. Quick to resent
an insult real or fancied, inflamed by unaccustomed drink, the ready
pistol always at his side, the tricks of the professional gambler to
provoke his sense of fair play, and finally his own wild recklessness
to urge him on,&mdash;all these combined forces sometimes brought him into
tragic conflict with another spirit equally heedless and daring. Not
nearly so often, however, as one might suppose, did he die with his
boots on. Many of the most wealthy and respected citizens now living
in the border states served as cowboys before settling down to quiet
domesticity.</p>

<p>A cow-camp in the seventies generally contained several <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxi" name="pagexxi"></a>(p. xxi)</span>
types of men. It was not unusual to find a negro who, because of his
ability to handle wild horses or because of his skill with a lasso,
had been promoted from the chuck-wagon to a place in the ranks of the
cowboys. Another familiar figure was the adventurous younger son of
some British family, through whom perhaps became current the English
ballads found in the West. Furthermore, so considerable was the number
of men who had fled from the States because of grave imprudence or
crime, it was bad form to inquire too closely about a person's real
name or where he came from. Most cowboys, however, were bold young
spirits who emigrated to the West for the same reason that their
ancestors had come across the seas. They loved roving; they loved
freedom; they were pioneers by instinct; an impulse set their faces
from the East, put the tang for roaming in their veins, and sent them
ever, ever westward.</p>

<p>That the cowboy was brave has come to be axiomatic. If his life of
isolation made him taciturn, it at the same time created a spirit of
hospitality, primitive and hearty as that found in the mead-halls of
Beowulf. He faced the wind and the rain, the snow of winter, the
fearful dust-storms of alkali desert wastes, with the same
uncomplaining quiet. Not all his work was on the ranch and the trail.
To the cowboy, more than to the goldseekers, more than to Uncle Sam's
soldiers, is due the conquest of the West. Along his winding cattle
trails the Forty-Niners <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxii" name="pagexxii"></a>(p. xxii)</span> found their way to California. The
cowboy has fought back the Indians ever since ranching became a
business and as long as Indians remained to be fought. He played his
part in winning the great slice of territory that the United States
took away from Mexico. He has always been on the skirmish line of
civilization. Restless, fearless, chivalric, elemental, he lived hard,
shot quick and true, and died with his face to his foe. Still much
misunderstood, he is often slandered, nearly always caricatured, both
by the press and by the stage. Perhaps these songs, coming direct from
the cowboy's experience, giving vent to his careless and his tender
emotions, will afford future generations a truer conception of what he
really was than is now possessed by those who know him only through
highly colored romances.</p>

<p>The big ranches of the West are now being cut up into small farms. The
nester has come, and come to stay. Gone is the buffalo, the Indian
warwhoop, the free grass of the open plain;&mdash;even the stinging lizard,
the horned frog, the centipede, the prairie dog, the rattlesnake, are
fast disappearing. Save in some of the secluded valleys of southern
New Mexico, the old-time round-up is no more; the trails to Kansas and
to Montana have become grass-grown or lost in fields of waving grain;
the maverick steer, the regal longhorn, has been supplanted by his
unpoetic but more beefy and profitable Polled Angus, Durham, and
Hereford cousins from across the seas. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxiii" name="pagexxiii"></a>(p. xxiii)</span> changing and
romantic West of the early days lives mainly in story and in song. The
last figure to vanish is the cowboy, the animating spirit of the
vanishing era. He sits his horse easily as he rides through a wide
valley, enclosed by mountains, clad in the hazy purple of coming
night,&mdash;with his face turned steadily down the long, long road, "the
road that the sun goes down." Dauntless, reckless, without the
unearthly purity of Sir Galahad though as gentle to a pure woman as
King Arthur, he is truly a knight of the twentieth century. A vagrant
puff of wind shakes a corner of the crimson handkerchief knotted
loosely at his throat; the thud of his pony's feet mingling with the
jingle of his spurs is borne back; and as the careless, gracious,
lovable figure disappears over the divide, the breeze brings to the
ears, faint and far yet cheery still, the refrain of a cowboy song:</p>

<p>
Whoopee ti yi, git along, little dogies;<br>
<span class="add1em">It's my misfortune and none of your own.</span><br>
Whoopee ti yi, git along, little dogies;<br>
<span class="add1em">For you know Wyoming will be your new home.</span></p>


<p>As for the songs of this collection, I have violated the ethics of
ballad-gatherers, in a few instances, by selecting and putting
together what seemed to be the best lines from different versions, all
telling the same story. Frankly, the volume is meant to be popular.
The songs have been arranged in some such haphazard way <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxiv" name="pagexxiv"></a>(p. xxiv)</span>
as they were collected,&mdash;jotted down on a table in the rear of
saloons, scrawled on an envelope while squatting about a campfire,
caught behind the scenes of a broncho-busting outfit. Later, it is
hoped that enough interest will be aroused to justify printing all the
variants of these songs, accompanied by the music and such explanatory
notes as may be useful; the negro folk-songs, the songs of the lumber
jacks, the songs of the mountaineers, and the songs of the sea,
already partially collected, being included in the final publication.
The songs of this collection, never before in print, as a rule have
been taken down from oral recitation. In only a few instances have I
been able to discover the authorship of any song. They seem to have
sprung up as quietly and mysteriously as does the grass on the plains.
All have been popular with the range riders, several being current all
the way from Texas to Montana, and quite as long as the old Chisholm
Trail stretching between these states. Some of the songs the cowboy
certainly composed; all of them he sang. Obviously, a number of the
most characteristic cannot be printed for general circulation. To
paraphrase slightly what Sidney Lanier said of Walt Whitman's poetry,
they are raw collops slashed from the rump of Nature, and never mind
the gristle. Likewise some of the strong adjectives and nouns have
been softened,&mdash;Jonahed, as George Meredith would have said. There is,
however, a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxv" name="pagexxv"></a>(p. xxv)</span> Homeric quality about the cowboy's profanity and
vulgarity that pleases rather than repulses. The broad sky under which
he slept, the limitless plains over which he rode, the big, open, free
life he lived near to Nature's breast, taught him simplicity, calm,
directness. He spoke out plainly the impulses of his heart. But as yet
so-called polite society is not quite willing to hear.</p>

<p>It is entirely impossible to acknowledge the assistance I have
received from many persons. To Professors Barrett Wendell and G.L.
Kittredge, of Harvard, I must gratefully acknowledge constant and
generous encouragement. Messrs. Jeff Hanna, of Meridian, Texas; John
B. Jones, a student of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of
Texas; H. Knight, Sterling City, Texas; John Lang Sinclair, San
Antonio; A.H. Belo &amp; Co., Dallas; Tom Hight, of Mangum, Oklahoma; R.
Bedichek, of Deming, N.M.; Benjamin Wyche, Librarian of the Carnegie
Library, San Antonio; Mrs. M.B. Wight, of Ft. Thomas, Arizona; Dr.
L.W. Payne, Jr., and Dr. Morgan Callaway, Jr., of the University of
Texas; and my brother, R.C. Lomax, Austin;&mdash;have rendered me
especially helpful service in furnishing material, for which I also
render grateful thanks.</p>

<p>Among the negroes, rivermen, miners, soldiers, seamen, lumbermen,
railroad men, and ranchmen of the United States and Canada there are
many indigenous folk-songs not included in this volume. Of some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxvi" name="pagexxvi"></a>(p. xxvi)</span>
of them I have traces, and I shall surely run them down. I beg
the co-operation of all who are interested in this vital, however
humble, expression of American literature.</p>

<p>"O bury me not on the lone prairie,"<br>
These words came low and mournfully<br>
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay<br>
On his dying bed at the close of day.</p>

<p>He had wailed in pain till o'er his brow<br>
Death's shadows fast were gathering now;<br>
He thought of his home and his loved ones nigh<br>
As the cowboys gathered to see him die.</p>

<p class="add1em">"O bury me not on the lone prairie<br>
  Where the wild cayotes will howl o'er me,<br>
  In a narrow grave just six by three,<br>
  O bury me not on the lone prairie.</p>

<p>"In fancy I listen to the well known words<br>
Of the free, wild winds and the song of the birds;<br>
I think of home and the cottage in the bower<br>
And the scenes I loved in my childhood's hour.</p>

<p>"It matters not, I've oft been told,<br>
Where the body lies when the heart grows cold;<br>
Yet grant, Oh grant this wish to me,<br>
O bury me not on the lone prairie.</p>

<p class="add1em">"O <span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span> then bury me not on the lone prairie,<br>
  In a narrow grave six foot by three,<br>
  Where the buffalo paws o'er a prairie sea,<br>
  O bury me not on the lone prairie.</p>

<p>"I've always wished to be laid when I died<br>
In the little churchyard on the green hillside;<br>
By my father's grave, there let mine be,<br>
And bury me not on the lone prairie.</p>

<p>"Let my death slumber be where my mother's prayer<br>
And a sister's tear will mingle there,<br>
Where my friends can come and weep o'er me;<br>
O bury me not on the lone prairie.</p>

<p class="add1em">"O bury me not on the lone prairie<br>

  Where the buzzard waits and the wind blows free;<br>
  Then bury me not on the lone prairie.</p>

<p>"There is another whose tears may be shed<br>
For one who lies on a prairie bed;<br>
It pained me then and it pains me now;&mdash;<br>
She has curled these locks, she has kissed this brow.</p>

<p>"These locks she has curled, shall the rattlesnake kiss?<br>
This brow she has kissed, shall the cold grave press?<br>
For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span> the sake of the loved ones that will weep for me<br>
O bury me not on the lone prairie.</p>

  Where the buzzard beats and the wind goes free,<br>
  O bury me not on the lone prairie.</p>

<p>"O bury me not," and his voice failed there,<br>
But we took no heed of his dying prayer;<br>
In a narrow grave just six by three<br>
We buried him there on the lone prairie.</p>

<p>Where the dew-drops glow and the butterflies rest,<br>
And the flowers bloom o'er the prairie's crest;<br>
Where the wild cayote and winds sport free<br>
On a wet saddle blanket lay a cowboy-ee.</p>

<p class="add1em">"O bury me not on the lone prairie<br>
  Where the wild cayotes will howl o'er me,<br>
  Where the rattlesnakes hiss and the crow flies free<br>
  O bury me not on the lone prairie."</p>

<p>O we buried him there on the lone prairie<br>
Where the wild rose blooms and the wind blows free,<br>
O his pale young face nevermore to see,&mdash;<br>
For we buried him there on the lone prairie.</p>

<p>Yes, we buried him there on the lone prairie<br>
Where the owl all night hoots mournfully,<br>
And the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> blizzard beats and the winds blow free<br>
O'er his lowly grave on the lone prairie.</p>

<p>And the cowboys now as they roam the plain,&mdash;<br>
For they marked the spot where his bones were lain,&mdash;<br>
Fling a handful of roses o'er his grave,<br>
With a prayer to Him who his soul will save.</p>

<p class="tit-song">THE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> DAYS OF FORTY-NINE</p>


<p>We are gazing now on old Tom Moore,<br>
A relic of bygone days;<br>
'Tis a bummer, too, they call me now,<br>
But what cares I for praise?<br>
It's oft, says I, for the days gone by,<br>
It's oft do I repine<br>
For the days of old when we dug out the gold<br>
In those days of Forty-Nine.</p>

<p>My comrades they all loved me well,<br>
The jolly, saucy crew;<br>
A few hard cases, I will admit,<br>
Though they were brave and true.<br>
Whatever the pinch, they ne'er would flinch;<br>
They never would fret nor whine,<br>
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks<br>
In the days of Forty-Nine.</p>

<p>There's old "Aunt Jess," that hard old cuss,<br>
Who never would repent;<br>
He never missed a single meal,<br>
Nor never paid a cent.<br>
But old "Aunt Jess," like all the rest,<br>
At death he did resign,<br>
And in his bloom went up the flume<br>
In the days of Forty-Nine.</p>

<p>There <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> is Ragshag Jim, the roaring man,<br>
Who could out-roar a buffalo, you bet,<br>
He roared all day and he roared all night,<br>
And I guess he is roaring yet.<br>
One night Jim fell in a prospect hole,&mdash;<br>
It was a roaring bad design,&mdash;<br>
And in that hole Jim roared out his soul<br>
In the days of Forty-Nine.</p>

<p>There is Wylie Bill, the funny man,<br>
Who was full of funny tricks,<br>
And when he was in a poker game<br>
He was always hard as bricks.<br>
He would ante you a stud, he would play you a draw,<br>
He'd go you a hatful blind,&mdash;<br>
In a struggle with death Bill lost his breath<br>
In the days of Forty-Nine.</p>

<p>There was New York Jake, the butcher boy,<br>
Who was fond of getting tight.<br>
And every time he got on a spree<br>
He was spoiling for a fight.<br>
One night Jake rampaged against a knife<br>
In the hands of old Bob Sine,<br>
And over Jake they held a wake<br>
In the days of Forty-Nine.</p>

<p>There was Monte Pete, I'll ne'er forget<br>
The luck he always had,<br>
He would deal for you both day and night<br>
Or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span> as long as he had a scad.<br>
It was a pistol shot that lay Pete out,<br>
It was his last resign,<br>
And it caught Pete dead sure in the door<br>
In the days of Forty-Nine.</p>

<p>Of all the comrades that I've had<br>
There's none that's left to boast,<br>
And I am left alone in my misery<br>
Like some poor wandering ghost.<br>
And as I pass from town to town,<br>
They call me the rambling sign,<br>
Since the days of old and the days of gold<br>
And the days of Forty-Nine.</p>

<p class="tit-song">JOE BOWERS</p> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015"></a>(p. 015)</span>

<p>My name is Joe Bowers,<br>
I've got a brother Ike,<br>
I came here from Missouri,<br>
Yes, all the way from Pike.<br>
I'll tell you why I left there<br>
And how I came to roam,<br>
And leave my poor old mammy,<br>
So far away from home.</p>

<p>I used to love a gal there,<br>
Her name was Sallie Black,<br>
I asked her for to marry me,<br>
She said it was a whack.<br>
She says to me, "Joe Bowers,<br>
Before you hitch for life,<br>
You ought to have a little home<br>
To keep your little wife."</p>

<p>Says I, "My dearest Sallie,<br>
O Sallie, for your sake,<br>
I'll go to California<br>
And try to raise a stake."<br>
Says she to me, "Joe Bowers,<br>
You are the chap to win,<br>
Give me a kiss to seal the bargain,"&mdash;<br>
And I throwed a dozen in.</p>

<p>I'll never forget my feelings <span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span><br>
When I bid adieu to all.<br>
Sal, she cotched me round the neck<br>
And I began to bawl.<br>
When I begun they all commenced,<br>
You never heard the like,<br>
How they all took on and cried<br>
The day I left old Pike.</p>

<p>When I got to this here country<br>
I hadn't nary a red,<br>
I had such wolfish feelings<br>
I wished myself most dead.<br>
At last I went to mining,<br>
Put in my biggest licks,<br>
Came down upon the boulders<br>
Just like a thousand bricks.</p>

<p>I worked both late and early<br>
In rain and sun and snow,<br>
But I was working for my Sallie<br>
So 'twas all the same to Joe.<br>
I made a very lucky strike<br>
As the gold itself did tell,<br>
For I was working for my Sallie,<br>
The girl I loved so well.</p>

<p>But one day I got a letter<br>
From my dear, kind brother Ike;<br>
It came from old Missouri,<br>
Yes, all the way from Pike.<br>
It told me the goldarndest news <span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span><br>
That ever you did hear,<br>
My heart it is a-bustin'<br>
So please excuse this tear.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what it was, boys,<br>
You'll bust your sides I know;<br>
For when I read that letter<br>
You ought to seen poor Joe.<br>
My knees gave 'way beneath me,<br>
And I pulled out half my hair;<br>
And if you ever tell this now,<br>
You bet you'll hear me swear.</p>

<p>It said my Sallie was fickle,<br>
Her love for me had fled,<br>
That she had married a butcher,<br>
Whose hair was awful red;<br>
It told me more than that,<br>
It's enough to make me swear,&mdash;<br>
It said that Sallie had a baby<br>
And the baby had red hair.</p>

<p>Now I've told you all that I can tell<br>
About this sad affair,<br>
'Bout Sallie marrying the butcher<br>
And the baby had red hair.<br>
But whether it was a boy or girl<br>
The letter never said,<br>
It only said its cussed hair<br>
Was inclined to be red.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE COWBOY'S DREAM<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span></p>

<p>Last night as I lay on the prairie,<br>
And looked at the stars in the sky,<br>
I wondered if ever a cowboy<br>
Would drift to that sweet by and by.</p>

<p class="add1em">Roll on, roll on;<br>
  Roll on, little dogies, roll on, roll on,<br>
  Roll on, roll on;<br>
  Roll on, little dogies, roll on.</p>

<p>The road to that bright, happy region<br>
Is a dim, narrow trail, so they say;<br>
But the broad one that leads to perdition<br>
Is posted and blazed all the way.</p>

<p>They say there will be a great round-up,<br>
And cowboys, like dogies, will stand,<br>
To be marked by the Riders of Judgment<br>
Who are posted and know every brand.</p>

<p>I know there's many a stray cowboy<br>
Who'll be lost at the great, final sale,<br>
When he might have gone in the green pastures<br>
Had he known of the dim, narrow trail.</p>

<p>I wonder if ever a cowboy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span><br>
Stood ready for that Judgment Day,<br>
And could say to the Boss of the Riders,<br>
"I'm ready, come drive me away."</p>

<p>For they, like the cows that are locoed,<br>
Stampede at the sight of a hand,<br>
Are dragged with a rope to the round-up,<br>
Or get marked with some crooked man's brand.</p>

<p>And I'm scared that I'll be a stray yearling,&mdash;<br>
A maverick, unbranded on high,&mdash;<br>
And get cut in the bunch with the "rusties"<br>
When the Boss of the Riders goes by.</p>

<p>For they tell of another big owner<br>
Whose ne'er overstocked, so they say,<br>
But who always makes room for the sinner<br>
Who drifts from the straight, narrow way.</p>

<p>They say he will never forget you,<br>
That he knows every action and look;<br>
So, for safety, you'd better get branded,<br>
Have your name in the great Tally Book.</p>

<p>The bawl of a steer,<br>
To a cowboy's ear,<br>
Is music of sweetest strain;<br>
And the yelping notes<br>
Of the gray cayotes<br>
To him are a glad refrain.</p>

<p>And his jolly songs<br>
Speed him along,<br>
As he thinks of the little gal<br>
With golden hair<br>
Who is waiting there<br>
At the bars of the home corral.</p>

<p>For a kingly crown<br>
In the noisy town<br>
His saddle he wouldn't change;<br>
No life so free<br>
As the life we see<br>
Way out on the Yaso range.</p>

<p>His eyes are bright<br>
And his heart as light<br>
As the smoke of his cigarette;<br>
There's never a care<br>
For his soul to bear, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021"></a>(p. 021)</span><br>
No trouble to make him fret.</p>

<p>The rapid beat<br>
Of his broncho's feet<br>
On the sod as he speeds along,<br>
Keeps living time<br>
To the ringing rhyme<br>
Of his rollicking cowboy song.</p>

<p>Hike it, cowboys,<br>
For the range away<br>
On the back of a bronc of steel,<br>
With a careless flirt<br>
Of the raw-hide quirt<br>
And a dig of a roweled heel!</p>

<p>The winds may blow<br>
And the thunder growl<br>
Or the breezes may safely moan;&mdash;<br>
A cowboy's life<br>
Is a royal life,<br>
His saddle his kingly throne.</p>

<p>Saddle up, boys,<br>
For the work is play<br>
When love's in the cowboy's eyes,&mdash;<br>
When his heart is light<br>
As the clouds of white<br>
That swim in the summer skies.</p>

<p>Now, O Lord, please lend me thine ear,<br>
The prayer of a cattleman to hear,<br>
No doubt the prayers may seem strange,<br>
But I want you to bless our cattle range.</p>

<p>Bless the round-ups year by year,<br>
And don't forget the growing steer;<br>
Water the lands with brooks and rills<br>
For my cattle that roam on a thousand hills.</p>

<p>Prairie fires, won't you please stop?<br>
Let thunder roll and water drop.<br>
It frightens me to see the smoke;<br>
Unless it's stopped, I'll go dead broke.</p>

<p>As you, O Lord, my herd behold,<br>
It represents a sack of gold;<br>
I think at least five cents a pound<br>
Will be the price of beef the year around.</p>

<p>One thing more and then I'm through,&mdash;<br>
Instead of one calf, give my cows two.<br>
I may pray different from other men<br>
But I've had my say, and now, Amen.</p>

<p>In a rusty, worn-out cabin sat a broken-hearted leaser,<br>
His singlejack was resting on his knee.<br>
His old "buggy" in the corner told the same old plaintive tale,<br>
His ore had left in all his poverty.<br>
He lifted his old singlejack, gazed on its battered face,<br>
And said: "Old boy, I know we're not to blame;<br>
Our gold has us forsaken, some other path it's taken,<br>
But I still believe we'll strike it just the same.</p>

<p class="add1em">"We'll strike it, yes, we'll strike it just the same,<br>

<p>"For forty years I've hammered steel and tried to make a strike,<br>
I've burned twice the powder Custer ever saw.<br>

My jack's ate all my books on mining law.<br>
I've <span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> worn gunny-sacks for overalls, and 'California socks,'<br>

I've lived on powder, smoke, and bacon, that's no lie, boy, I'm not fakin',<br>
But I still believe we'll strike it just the same.</p>

<p>"Last night as I lay sleeping in the midst of all my dream<br>
My assay ran six ounces clear in gold,<br>
And the silver it ran clean sixteen ounces to the seam,<br>
And the poor old miner's joy could scarce be told.<br>
I lay there, boy, I could not sleep, I had a feverish brow,<br>
Got up, went back, and put in six holes more.<br>
And then, boy, I was chokin' just to see the ground I'd broken;<br>
But alas! alas! the miner's dream was o'er.</p>

<p class="add1em">"We'll strike it, yes, we'll strike it just the same,<br>

<p>Jesse James was a lad that killed a-many a man;<br>
He robbed the Danville train.<br>
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard<br>
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</p>

<p class="add2em">Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,<br>
    Three children, they were brave.<br>
    But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard<br>

<p>It was Robert Ford, that dirty little coward,<br>
I wonder how he does feel,<br>
For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed,<br>
Then laid poor Jesse in his grave.</p>

<p>Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor,<br>
He never would see a man suffer pain;<br>
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Chicago bank,<br>
And stopped the Glendale train.</p>

<p>It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank,<br>
And carried the money from the town;<br>
It was in this very place that they had a little race,<br>
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground.</p>

<p>They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span> went to the crossing not very far from there,<br>
And there they did the same;<br>
With the agent on his knees, he delivered up the keys<br>
To the outlaws, Frank and Jesse James.</p>

<p>It was on Wednesday night, the moon was shining bright,<br>
They robbed the Glendale train;<br>
The people they did say, for many miles away,<br>
It was robbed by Frank and Jesse James.</p>

<p>It was on Saturday night, Jesse was at home<br>
Talking with his family brave,<br>
Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night<br>
And laid poor Jesse in his grave.</p>

<p>The people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death,<br>
And wondered how he ever came to die.<br>
It was one of the gang called little Robert Ford,<br>
He shot poor Jesse on the sly.</p>

<p>Jesse went to his rest with his hand on his breast;<br>
The devil will be upon his knee.<br>
He was born one day in the county of Clay<br>
And came from a solitary race.</p>

<p>This song was made by Billy Gashade,<br>
As soon as the news did arrive;<br>
He said there was no man with the law in his hand<br>
Who could take Jesse James when alive.</p>

<p>On Buena Vista battlefield<br>
A dying soldier lay,<br>
His thoughts were on his mountain home<br>
Some thousand miles away.<br>
He called his comrade to his side,<br>
For much he had to say,<br>
In briefest words to those who were<br>
Some thousand miles away.</p>

<p>"My father, comrade, you will tell<br>
About this bloody fray;<br>
My country's flag, you'll say to him,<br>
Was safe with me to-day.<br>
I make a pillow of it now<br>
On which to lay my head,<br>
A winding sheet you'll make of it<br>
When I am with the dead.</p>

<p>"I know 'twill grieve his inmost soul<br>
To think I never more<br>
Will sit with him beneath the oak<br>
That shades the cottage door;<br>
But tell that time-worn patriot,<br>
That, mindful of his fame,<br>
Upon this bloody battlefield<br>
I sullied not his name.</p>

<p>"My <span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span> mother's form is with me now,<br>

So flows from her the tear.<br>
And oh, when you shall tell to her<br>
The tidings of this day,<br>
Speak softly, comrade, softly speak<br>
What you may have to say.</p>

<p>"Speak not to her in blighting words<br>
The blighting news you bear,<br>
The cords of life might snap too soon,<br>
So, comrade, have a care.<br>
I am her only, cherished child,<br>
But tell her that I died<br>
Rejoicing that she taught me young<br>
To take my country's side.</p>

<p>"But, comrade, there's one more,<br>
She's gentle as a fawn;<br>
She lives upon the sloping hill<br>
That overlooks the lawn,<br>
The lawn where I shall never more<br>
Go forth with her in merry mood<br>
To gather wild-wood flowers.</p>

<p>"Tell her when death was on my brow<br>
And life receding fast,<br>

Were with me to the last.<br>

<p>Come, all you Texas rangers, wherever you may be,<br>
I'll tell you of some troubles that happened unto me.<br>
My name is nothing extra, so it I will not tell,&mdash;<br>
And here's to all you rangers, I am sure I wish you well.</p>

<p>It was at the age of sixteen that I joined the jolly band,<br>
We marched from San Antonio down to the Rio Grande.<br>
Our captain he informed us, perhaps he thought it right,<br>
"Before we reach the station, boys, you'll surely have to fight."</p>

<p>And when the bugle sounded our captain gave command,<br>
"To arms, to arms," he shouted, "and by your horses stand."<br>
I saw the smoke ascending, it seemed to reach the sky;<br>
The first thought that struck me, my time had come to die.</p>

<p>I saw the Indians coming, I heard them give the yell;<br>
My feelings at that moment, no tongue can ever tell.<br>
I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> saw the glittering lances, their arrows round me flew,<br>
And all my strength it left me and all my courage too.</p>

<p>We fought full nine hours before the strife was o'er,<br>
The like of dead and wounded I never saw before.<br>
And when the sun was rising and the Indians they had fled,<br>
We loaded up our rifles and counted up our dead.</p>

<p>And all of us were wounded, our noble captain slain,<br>
And the sun was shining sadly across the bloody plain.<br>
Sixteen as brave rangers as ever roamed the West<br>
Were buried by their comrades with arrows in their breast.</p>

<p>'Twas then I thought of mother, who to me in tears did say,<br>
"To you they are all strangers, with me you had better stay."<br>
I thought that she was childish, the best she did not know;<br>
My mind was fixed on ranging and I was bound to go.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have a mother, likewise a sister too,<br>
And maybe you have a sweetheart to weep and mourn for you;<br>
If <span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span> that be your situation, although you'd like to roam,<br>
I'd advise you by experience, you had better stay at home.</p>

<p>I have seen the fruits of rambling, I know its hardships well;<br>
I have crossed the Rocky Mountains, rode down the streets of hell;<br>
I have been in the great Southwest where the wild Apaches roam,<br>
And I tell you from experience you had better stay at home.</p>

<p>And now my song is ended; I guess I have sung enough;<br>
The life of a ranger I am sure is very tough.<br>
And here's to all you ladies, I am sure I wish you well,<br>
I am bound to go a-ranging, so ladies, fare you well.</p>

<p>I am a Mormon bishop and I will tell you what I know.<br>
I joined the confraternity some forty years ago.<br>
I then had youth upon my brow and eloquence my tongue,<br>
But I had the sad misfortune then to meet with Brigham Young.</p>

<p>He said, "Young man, come join our band and bid hard work farewell,<br>
You are too smart to waste your time in toil by hill and dell;<br>
There is a ripening harvest and our hooks shall find the fool<br>
And in the distant nations we shall train them in our school."</p>

<p>I listened to his preaching and I learned all the role,<br>
And the truth of Mormon doctrines burned deep within my soul.<br>
I married sixteen women and I spread my new belief,<br>
I was sent to preach the gospel to the pauper and the thief.</p>

<p>'Twas in the glorious days when Brigham was our only Lord and King,<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> his wild cry of defiance from the Wasatch tops did ring,<br>
'Twas when that bold Bill Hickman and that Porter Rockwell led,<br>
And in the blood atonements the pits received the dead.</p>

<p>They took in Dr. Robertson and left him in his gore,<br>
And the Aiken brothers sleep in peace on Nephi's distant shore.<br>
We marched to Mountain Meadows and on that glorious field<br>
With rifle and with hatchet we made man and woman yield.</p>

<p>'Twas there we were victorious with our legions fierce and brave.<br>
We left the butchered victims on the ground without a grave.<br>
We slew the load of emigrants on Sublet's lonely road<br>
And plundered many a trader of his then most precious load.</p>

<p>Alas for all the powers that were in the by-gone time.<br>
What we did as deeds of glory are condemned as bloody crime.<br>
No <span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049"></a>(p. 049)</span> more the blood atonements keep the doubting one in fear,<br>
While the faithful were rewarded with a wedding once a year.</p>

<p>As the nation's chieftain president says our days of rule are o'er<br>
And his marshals with their warrants are on watch at every door,<br>
Old John he now goes skulking on the by-roads of our land,<br>
Or unknown he keeps in hiding with the faithful of our band.</p>

<p>Old Brigham now is stretched beneath the cold and silent clay,<br>
And the chieftains now are fallen that were mighty in their day;<br>
Of the six and twenty women that I wedded long ago<br>
There are two now left to cheer me in these awful hours of woe.<br>
The rest are scattered where the Gentile's flag's unfurled<br>
And two score of my daughters are now numbered with the world.</p>

<p>Oh, my poor old bones are aching and my head is turning gray;<br>
Oh, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span> the scenes were black and awful that I've witnessed in my day.<br>

And he savies how it's done.</p>

<p>He used to be a cowboy<br>
And they say he wasn't slow,<br>
He could ride the bucking bronco<br>
And swing the long lasso.</p>

<p>He could catch a maverick by the head<br>
Or heel him on the fly,<br>
He could pick up his front ones<br>
Whenever he chose to try.</p>

<p>He used to ride most anything;<br>
Now he seldom will.<br>
He says they cut some caper in the air<br>
Of which he's got his fill.</p>

<p>He is done and quit the business,<br>
Settled down to quiet life,<br>
And he's hunting for some maiden<br>
Who will be his little wife,&mdash;</p>

<p>One <span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052"></a>(p. 052)</span> who will wash and patch his britches<br>
And feed the setting hen,<br>
Milk old Blue and Brindy,<br>
And tend to baby Ben.</p>

<p>Then he'll build a cozy cottage<br>
And furnish it complete,<br>
He'll decorate the walls inside<br>
With pictures new and sweet.</p>

<p>He will leave off riding broncos<br>
And be a different man;<br>
He will do his best to please his wife<br>
In every way he can.</p>

<p>Then together in double harness<br>
They will trot along down the line,<br>
Until death shall call them over<br>
To a bright and sunny clime.</p>

<p>May your joys be then completed<br>
And your sorrows have amend,<br>
Is the fondest wish of the writer,&mdash;<br>
Your true and faithful friend.</p>


<p class="tit-song">WHEN WORK IS DONE THIS FALL <span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span></p>

<p>A group of jolly cowboys, discussing plans at ease,<br>
Says one, "I'll tell you something, boys, if you will listen, please.<br>
I am an old cow-puncher and here I'm dressed in rags,<br>
And I used to be a tough one and take on great big jags.</p>

<p>"But I've got a home, boys, a good one, you all know,<br>
Although I have not seen it since long, long ago.<br>
I'm going back to Dixie once more to see them all;<br>
Yes, I'm going to see my mother when the work's all done this fall.</p>

<p class="add1em">"After the round-ups are over and after the shipping is done,<br>
I am going right straight home, boys, ere all my money is gone.<br>
I have changed my ways, boys, no more will I fall;<br>
And I am going home, boys, when work is done this fall.</p>

<p>"When I left home, boys, my mother for me cried,<br>
Begged me not to go, boys, for me she would have died;<br>
My <span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span> mother's heart is breaking, breaking for me, that's all,<br>
And with God's help I'll see her when the work's all done this fall."</p>

<p>That very night this cowboy went out to stand his guard;<br>
The night was dark and cloudy and storming very hard;<br>
The cattle they got frightened and rushed in wild stampede,<br>
The cowboy tried to head them, riding at full speed.</p>

<p>While riding in the darkness so loudly did he shout,<br>
Trying his best to head them and turn the herd about,<br>
His saddle horse did stumble and on him did fall,<br>
The poor boy won't see his mother when the work's all done this fall.</p>

<p>His body was so mangled the boys all thought him dead,<br>
They picked him up so gently and laid him on a bed;<br>
He opened wide his blue eyes and looking all around<br>
He motioned to his comrades to sit near him on the ground.</p>

<p>"Boys, send mother my wages, the wages I have earned,<br>
For I'm afraid, boys, my last steer I have turned.<br>
I'm <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span> going to a new range, I hear my Master's call,<br>
And I'll not see my mother when the work's all done this fall.</p>

<p>"Fred, you take my saddle; George, you take my bed;<br>
Bill, you take my pistol after I am dead,<br>
And think of me kindly when you look upon them all,<br>
For I'll not see my mother when work is done this fall."</p>

<p>Poor Charlie was buried at sunrise, no tombstone at his head,<br>
Nothing but a little board and this is what it said,<br>
"Charlie died at daybreak, he died from a fall,<br>
And he'll not see his mother when the work's all done this fall."</p>


<p class="tit-song">SIOUX INDIANS <span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span></p>

<p>I'll sing you a song, though it may be a sad one,<br>
Of trials and troubles and where they first begun;<br>
I left my dear kindred, my friends, and my home,<br>
Across the wild deserts and mountains to roam.</p>

<p>I crossed the Missouri and joined a large train<br>
Which bore us over mountain and valley and plain;<br>
And often of evenings out hunting we'd go<br>
To shoot the fleet antelope and wild buffalo.</p>

<p>We heard of Sioux Indians all out on the plains<br>
A-killing poor drivers and burning their trains,&mdash;<br>
A-killing poor drivers with arrows and bow,<br>
When captured by Indians no mercy they show.</p>

<p>We traveled three weeks till we came to the Platte<br>
And pitched out our tents at the end of the flat,<br>
We spread down our blankets on the green grassy ground,<br>
While our horses and mules were grazing around.</p>

<p>While taking refreshment we heard a low yell,<br>
The whoop of Sioux Indians coming up from the dell;<br>
We sprang to our rifles with a flash in each eye,<br>
"Boys," says our brave leader, "we'll fight till we die."</p>

<p>They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span> made a bold dash and came near to our train<br>
And the arrows fell around us like hail and like rain,<br>
But with our long rifles we fed them cold lead<br>
Till many a brave warrior around us lay dead.</p>

<p>We shot their bold chief at the head of his band.<br>
He died like a warrior with a gun in his hand.<br>
When they saw their bold chief lying dead in his gore,<br>
They whooped and they yelled and we saw them no more.</p>

<p>With our small band,&mdash;there were just twenty-four,&mdash;<br>
And the Sioux Indians there were five hundred or more,&mdash;<br>
We fought them with courage; we spoke not a word,<br>
Till the end of the battle was all that was heard.</p>

<p>We hitched up our horses and we started our train;<br>
Three more bloody battles this trip on the plain;<br>
And in our last battle three of our brave boys fell,<br>
And we left them to rest in a green, shady dell.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE OLD CHISHOLM TRAIL <span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span></p>

<p>Come along, boys, and listen to my tale,<br>
I'll tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm trail.</p>

<p class="add2em">Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya, youpy ya,<br>
    Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya.</p>

<p>I started up the trail October twenty-third,<br>
I started up the trail with the 2-U herd.</p>

<p>Oh, a ten dollar hoss and a forty dollar saddle,&mdash;<br>
And I'm goin' to punchin' Texas cattle.</p>

<p>I woke up one morning on the old Chisholm trail,<br>
Rope in my hand and a cow by the tail.</p>

<p>I'm up in the mornin' afore daylight<br>
And afore I sleep the moon shines bright.</p>

<p>Old Ben Bolt was a blamed good boss,<br>
But he'd go to see the girls on a sore-backed hoss.</p>

<p>Old Ben Bolt was a fine old man<br>
And you'd know there was whiskey wherever he'd land.</p>

<p>My <span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span> hoss throwed me off at the creek called Mud,<br>
My hoss throwed me off round the 2-U herd.</p>

<p>Last time I saw him he was going cross the level<br>
A-kicking up his heels and a-running like the devil.</p>

<p>It's cloudy in the West, a-looking like rain,<br>
And my damned old slicker's in the wagon again.</p>

<p>Crippled my hoss, I don't know how,<br>
Ropin' at the horns of a 2-U cow.</p>

<p>We hit Caldwell and we hit her on the fly,<br>
We bedded down the cattle on the hill close by.</p>

<p>No chaps, no slicker, and it's pouring down rain,<br>
And I swear, by god, I'll never night-herd again.</p>

<p>Feet in the stirrups and seat in the saddle,<br>
I hung and rattled with them long-horn cattle.</p>

<p>Last night I was on guard and the leader broke the ranks,<br>
I hit my horse down the shoulders and I spurred him in the flanks.</p>

<p>The wind commenced to blow, and the rain began to fall,<br>
Hit looked, by grab, like we was goin' to loss 'em all.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span> jumped in the saddle and grabbed holt the horn,<br>
Best blamed cow-puncher ever was born.</p>

<p>I popped my foot in the stirrup and gave a little yell,<br>
The tail cattle broke and the leaders went to hell.</p>

<p>I don't give a damn if they never do stop;<br>
I'll ride as long as an eight-day clock.</p>

<p>Foot in the stirrup and hand on the horn,<br>
Best damned cowboy ever was born.</p>

<p>I herded and I hollered and I done very well,<br>
Till the boss said, "Boys, just let 'em go to hell."</p>

<p>Stray in the herd and the boss said kill it,<br>
So I shot him in the rump with the handle of the skillet.</p>

<p>We rounded 'em up and put 'em on the cars,<br>
And that was the last of the old Two Bars.</p>

<p>Oh it's bacon and beans most every day,&mdash;<br>
I'd as soon be a-eatin' prairie hay.</p>

<p>I'm on my best horse and I'm goin' at a run,<br>
I'm the quickest shootin' cowboy that ever pulled a gun.</p>

<p>I went to the wagon to get my roll,<br>
To come back to Texas, dad-burn my soul.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061"></a>(p. 061)</span> went to the boss to draw my roll,<br>
He had it figgered out I was nine dollars in the hole.</p>

<p>I'll sell my outfit just as soon as I can,<br>
I won't punch cattle for no damned man.</p>

<p>Goin' back to town to draw my money,<br>
Goin' back home to see my honey.</p>

<p>With my knees in the saddle and my seat in the sky,<br>
I'll quit punching cows in the sweet by and by.</p>

<p>Come, all you bold, undaunted men,<br>
You outlaws of the day,<br>
It's time to beware of the ball and chain<br>
And also slavery.<br>
Attention pay to what I say,<br>
And verily if you do,<br>
I will relate you the actual fate<br>
Of bold Jack Donahoo.</p>

<p>He had scarcely landed, as I tell you,<br>
Upon Australia's shore,<br>
Than he became a real highwayman,<br>
As he had been before.<br>
There was Underwood and Mackerman,<br>
And Wade and Westley too,<br>
These were the four associates<br>
Of bold Jack Donahoo.</p>

<p>Jack Donahoo, who was so brave,<br>
Rode out that afternoon,<br>
Knowing not that the pain of death<br>
Would overtake him soon.<br>
So quickly then the horse police<br>
From Sidney came to view;<br>
"Begone from here, you cowardly dogs,"<br>
Says bold Jack Donahoo.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span> captain and the sergeant<br>
Stopped then to decide.<br>
"Do you intend to fight us<br>
Or unto us resign?"<br>
"To surrender to such cowardly dogs<br>
Is more than I will do,<br>
This day I'll fight if I lose my life,"<br>
Says bold Jack Donahoo.</p>

<p>The captain and the sergeant<br>
The men they did divide;<br>
They fired from behind him<br>
And also from each side;<br>
It's six police he did shoot down<br>
Before the fatal ball<br>
Did pierce the heart of Donahoo<br>
And cause bold Jack to fall.</p>

<p>And when he fell, he closed his eyes,<br>
He bid the world adieu;<br>
Come, all you boys, and sing the song<br>
Of bold Jack Donahoo.</p>


<p class="tit-song">UTAH CARROLL <span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span></p>

<p>And as, my friend, you ask me what makes me sad and still,<br>
And why my brow is darkened like the clouds upon the hill;<br>
Run in your pony closer and I'll tell to you the tale<br>
Of Utah Carroll, my partner, and his last ride on the trail.</p>

<p>'Mid the cactus and the thistles of Mexico's fair lands,<br>
Where the cattle roam in thousands, a-many a herd and brand,<br>
There is a grave with neither headstone, neither date nor name,&mdash;<br>
There lies my partner sleeping in the land from which I came.</p>

<p>We rode the range together and had rode it side by side;<br>
I loved him as a brother, I wept when Utah died;<br>
We were rounding up one morning, our work was almost done,<br>
When on the side the cattle started on a mad and fearless run.</p>

<p>The boss man's little daughter was holding on that side.<br>
She <span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span> rushed; the cattle saw the blanket, they charged with maddened fear.<br>
And little Varro, seeing the danger, turned her pony a pace<br>
And leaning in the saddle, tied the blanket in its place.</p>

<p>In leaning, she lost her balance and fell in front of that wild tide.<br>
Utah's voice controlled the round-up. "Lay still, little Varro," he cried.<br>
His only hope was to raise her, to catch her at full speed,<br>
And oft-times he had been known to catch the trail rope off his steed.</p>

<p>His pony reached the maiden with a firm and steady bound;<br>
Utah swung out from the saddle to catch her from the ground.<br>
He swung out from the saddle, I thought her safe from harm,<br>
As he swung in his saddle to raise her in his arm.</p>

<p>But the cinches of his saddle had not been felt before,<br>
And his back cinch snapt asunder and he fell by the side of Varro.<br>
He picked up the blanket and swung it over his head<br>
And started across the prairie; "Lay still, little Varro," he said.</p>

<p>Well, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068"></a>(p. 068)</span> he got the stampede turned and saved little Varro, his friend.<br>
Then he turned to face the cattle and meet his fatal end.<br>
His six-shooter from his pocket, from the scabbard he quickly drew,&mdash;<br>
He was bound to die defended as all young cowboys do.</p>

<p>His six-shooter flashed like lightning, the report rang loud and clear;<br>
As the cattle rushed in and killed him he dropped the leading steer.<br>
And when we broke the circle where Utah's body lay,<br>
With many a wound and bruise his young life ebbed away.</p>

<p>"And in some future morning," I heard the preacher say,<br>
"I hope we'll all meet Utah at the round-up far away."<br>
Then we wrapped him in a blanket sent by his little friend,<br>
And it was that very red blanket that brought him to his end.</p>

<p>I'm a lonely bull-whacker<br>
On the Red Cloud line,<br>
I can lick any son of a gun<br>
That will yoke an ox of mine.<br>
And if I can catch him,<br>
You bet I will or try,<br>
I'd lick him with an ox-bow,&mdash;<br>
Root hog or die.</p>

<p>It's out on the road<br>
With a very heavy load,<br>
With a very awkward team<br>
And a very muddy road,<br>
You may whip and you may holler,<br>
But if you cuss it's on the sly;<br>
Then whack the cattle on, boys,&mdash;<br>
Root hog or die.</p>

<p>It's out on the road<br>
These sights are to be seen,<br>
The antelope and buffalo,<br>
The prairie all so green,&mdash;<br>
The antelope and buffalo,<br>
The rabbit jumps so high;<br>
It's whack the cattle on, boys,&mdash;<br>
Root hog or die.</p>

<p>It's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span> every day at twelve<br>
There's something for to do;<br>
And if there's nothing else,<br>
There's a pony for to shoe;<br>
I'll throw him down,<br>
And still I'll make him lie;<br>
Little pig, big pig,<br>
Root hog or die.</p>

<p>Now perhaps you'd like to know<br>
What we have to eat,<br>
A little piece of bread<br>
And a little dirty meat,<br>
A little black coffee,<br>
And whiskey on the sly;<br>
It's whack the cattle on, boys,&mdash;<br>
Root hog or die.</p>

<p>There's hard old times on Bitter Creek<br>
That never can be beat,<br>
It was root hog or die<br>
Under every wagon sheet;<br>
We cleaned up all the Indians,<br>
Drank all the alkali,<br>
And it's whack the cattle on, boys,&mdash;<br>
Root hog or die.</p>

<p>There was good old times in Salt Lake<br>
That never can pass by,<br>
It was there I first spied<br>
My China girl called Wi.<br>
She <span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071"></a>(p. 071)</span> could smile, she could chuckle,<br>
She could roll her hog eye;<br>
Then it's whack the cattle on, boys,&mdash;<br>
Root hog or die.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm going home<br>
Bull-whacking for to spurn,<br>
I ain't got a nickel,<br>
And I don't give a dern.<br>
'Tis when I meet a pretty girl,<br>
You bet I will or try,<br>
I'll make her my little wife,&mdash;<br>

<p>As I walked out in the streets of Laredo,<br>

I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen,<br>
Wrapped up in white linen as cold as the clay.</p>

<p class="add1em">"Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly,<br>
  Play the Dead March as you carry me along;<br>

"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story;<br>
I was shot in the breast and I know I must die.</p>

Before I turned, the spirit had left him<br>
And gone to its Giver,&mdash;the cowboy was dead.</p>

Have compassion on me, your friend I will be.<br>
Your fortune I'll tell besides.<br>
The lad you mourn will never return<br>
To make little Mary his bride."</p>

<p>She startled and trembled and then she did say,<br>
"All the fortune I have I freely give<br>
If what I ask you will tell unto me,&mdash;<br>
Say, does young William yet live?"<br>
"He lives and is true and poverty poor,<br>
And shipwreck has suffered beside;<br>
He'll return no more, because he is poor,<br>
To make little Mary his bride."</p>

<p>"No <span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span> tongue can tell the joy I do feel<br>
Although his misfortune I mourn,<br>
And he's welcome to me though poverty poor,<br>
His jacket all tattered and torn.<br>
I love him so dear, so true and sincere,<br>
I'll have no other beside;<br>
Those with riches enrobed and covered with gold<br>
Can't make little Mary their bride."</p>

<p>The beggar then tore the patch from his eye,<br>
His crutches he laid by his side,<br>
Coat, jacket and bundle; cheeks red as a rose,<br>
'Twas William that stood by her side.<br>
"Then excuse me, dear maid," to her he said,<br>
"It was only your love I tried."<br>
So he hastened away at the close of the day<br>
To make little Mary his bride.</p>

<p>There once was a noble ranger,<br>
They called him Mustang Gray;<br>
He left his home when but a youth,<br>
Went ranging far away.</p>

<p class="add1em">But he'll go no more a-ranging,<br>
  The savage to affright;<br>
  He has heard his last war-whoop,<br>
  And fought his last fight.</p>

<p>He ne'er would sleep within a tent,<br>
No comforts would he know;<br>
But like a brave old Tex-i-an,<br>
A-ranging he would go.</p>

<p>When Texas was invaded<br>
By a mighty tyrant foe,<br>
He mounted his noble war-horse<br>
And a-ranging he did go.</p>

<p>Once he was taken prisoner,<br>
Bound in chains upon the way,<br>
He wore the yoke of bondage<br>
Through the streets of Monterey.</p>

<p>A senorita loved him,<br>
And followed by his side;<br>
She <span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080"></a>(p. 080)</span> opened the gates and gave to him<br>
Her father's steed to ride.</p>

<p>God bless the senorita,<br>
The belle of Monterey,<br>
She opened wide the prison door<br>
And let him ride away.</p>

<p>And when this veteran's life was spent,<br>
It was his last command<br>
To bury him on Texas soil<br>
On the banks of the Rio Grande;</p>

<p>And there the lonely traveler,<br>
When passing by his grave,<br>
Will shed a farewell tear<br>
O'er the bravest of the brave.</p>

<p class="add1em">And he'll go no more a-ranging,<br>

<p>Come all you young companions<br>
And listen unto me,<br>
I'll tell you a story<br>
Of some bad company.</p>

<p>I was born in Pennsylvania<br>
Among the beautiful hills<br>
And the memory of my childhood<br>
Is warm within me still.</p>

<p>I did not like my fireside,<br>
I did not like my home;<br>
I had in view far rambling,<br>
So far away did roam.</p>

<p>I had a feeble mother,<br>
She oft would plead with me;<br>
And the last word she gave me<br>
Was to pray to God in need.</p>

<p>I had two loving sisters,<br>
As fair as fair could be,<br>
And oft beside me kneeling<br>
They oft would plead with me.</p>

<p>I bid adieu to loved ones,<br>
To my home I bid farewell,<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span> I landed in Chicago<br>
In the very depth of hell.</p>

<p>It was there I took to drinking,<br>
I sinned both night and day,<br>
And there within my bosom<br>
A feeble voice would say:</p>

<p>"Then fare you well, my loved one,<br>
May God protect my boy,<br>
And blessings ever with him<br>
Throughout his manhood joy."</p>

<p>I courted a fair young maiden,<br>
Her name I will not tell,<br>
For I should ever disgrace her<br>
Since I am doomed for hell.</p>

<p>It was on one beautiful evening,<br>
The stars were shining bright,<br>
And with a fatal dagger<br>
I bid her spirit flight.</p>

<p>So justice overtook me,<br>
You all can plainly see,<br>
My soul is doomed forever<br>
Throughout eternity.</p>

<p>It's now I'm on the scaffold,<br>
My moments are not long;<br>
You may forget the singer<br>
But don't forget the song.</p>


<p class="tit-song">LACKEY BILL <span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span></p>

<p>Come all you good old boys and listen to my rhymes,<br>
We are west of Eastern Texas and mostly men of crimes;<br>
Each with a hidden secret well smothered in his breast,<br>
Which brought us out to Mexico, way out here in the West.</p>

<p>My parents raised me tenderly, they had no child but me,<br>
Till I began to ramble and with them could never agree.<br>
My mind being bent on rambling did grieve their poor hearts sore,<br>
To leave my aged parents them to see no more.</p>

<p>I was borned and raised in Texas, though never come to fame,<br>
A cowboy by profession, C.W. King, by name.<br>
Oh, when the war was ended I did not like to work,<br>
My brothers were not happy, for I had learned to shirk.</p>

<p>In fact I was not able, my health was very bad,<br>
I had no constitution, I was nothing but a lad.<br>
I had no education, I would not go to school,<br>
And living off my parents I thought it rather cool.</p>

<p>So <span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span> I set a resolution to travel to the West,<br>
My parents they objected, but still I thought it best.<br>
It was out on the Seven Rivers all out on the Pecos stream,<br>
It was there I saw a country I thought just suited me.</p>

<p>I thought I would be no stranger and lead a civil life,<br>
In order to be happy would choose myself a wife.<br>
On one Sabbath evening in the merry month of May<br>
To a little country singing I happened there to stray.</p>

<p>It was there I met a damsel I never shall forget,<br>
The impulse of that moment remains within me yet.<br>
We soon became acquainted, I thought she would fill the bill,<br>
She seemed to be good-natured, which helps to climb the hill.</p>

<p>She was a handsome figure though not so very tall;<br>
Her hair was red as blazes, I hate it worst of all.<br>
I saw her home one evening in the presence of her pap,<br>
I bid them both good evening with a note left in her lap.</p>

<p>And when I got an answer I read it with a rush,<br>
I found she had consented, my feelings was a hush.<br>
But now I have changed my mind, boys, I am sure I wish her well.<br>
Here's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> to that precious jewel, I'm sure I wish her well.</p>

<p>This girl was Miss Mollie Walker who fell in love with me,<br>
She was a lovely Western girl, as lovely as could be,<br>
She was so tall, so handsome, so charming and so fair,<br>
There is not a girl in this whole world with her I could compare.</p>

<p>She said my pockets would be lined with gold, hard work then I'd leave o'er<br>
If I'd consent to live with her and say I'd roam no more.<br>
My mind began to ramble and it grieved my poor heart sore,<br>
To leave my darling girl, her to see no more.</p>

<p>I asked if it made any difference if I crossed o'er the plains;<br>
She said it made no difference if I returned again.<br>
So we kissed, shook hands, and parted, I left that girl behind.<br>
She said she'd prove true to me till death proved her unkind.</p>

<p>I rode in the town of Vagus, all in the public square;<br>
The mail coach had arrived, the post boy met me there.<br>
He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span> handed me a letter that gave me to understand<br>
That the girl I loved in Texas had married another man.</p>

<p>So I read a little farther and found those words were true.<br>
I turned myself all around, not knowing what to do.<br>
I'll sell my horse, saddle, and bridle, cow-driving I'll resign,<br>
I'll search this world from town to town for the girl I left behind.</p>

<p>Here the gold I find in plenty, the girls to me are kind,<br>
But my pillow is haunted with the girl I left behind.<br>
It's trouble and disappointment is all that I can see,<br>
For the dearest girl in all the world has gone square back on me.</p>

<p>As I walked out one morning for pleasure,<br>
I spied a cow-puncher all riding alone;<br>
His hat was throwed back and his spurs was a jingling,<br>
As he approached me a-singin' this song,</p>

<p class="add1em">Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,<br>
  It's your misfortune, and none of my own.<br>
  Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies,<br>
  For you know Wyoming will be your new home.</p>

<p>Early in the spring we round up the dogies,<br>
Mark and brand and bob off their tails;<br>
Round up our horses, load up the chuck-wagon,<br>
Then throw the dogies upon the trail.</p>

<p>It's whooping and yelling and driving the dogies;<br>
Oh how I wish you would go on;<br>
It's whooping and punching and go on little dogies,<br>
For you know Wyoming will be your new home.</p>

<p>Some boys goes up the trail for pleasure,<br>
But that's where you get it most awfully wrong;<br>
For you haven't any idea the trouble they give us<br>
While we go driving them all along.</p>

<p>When <span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span> the night comes on and we hold them on the bedground,<br>
These little dogies that roll on so slow;<br>
Roll up the herd and cut out the strays,<br>
And roll the little dogies that never rolled before.</p>

<p>Your mother she was raised way down in Texas,<br>
Where the jimson weed and sand-burrs grow;<br>
Now we'll fill you up on prickly pear and cholla<br>
Till you are ready for the trail to Idaho.</p>

<p>Oh, you'll be soup for Uncle Sam's Injuns;<br>
"It's beef, heap beef," I hear them cry.<br>
Git along, git along, git along little dogies<br>
You're going to be beef steers by and by.</p>

<p>O come cowboys and listen to my song,<br>
I'm in hopes I'll please you and not keep you long;<br>
I'll sing you of things you may think strange<br>
About West Texas and the U-S-U range.</p>

<p>You may go to Stamford and there see a man<br>
Who wears a white shirt and is asking for hands;<br>
You may ask him for work and he'll answer you short,<br>
He will hurry you up, for he wants you to start.<br>
He will put you in a wagon and be off in the rain,<br>
You will go up on Tongue River on the U-S-U range.</p>

<p>You will drive up to the ranch and there you will stop.<br>
It's a little sod house with dirt all on top.<br>
You will ask what it is and they will tell you out plain<br>
That it's the ranch house on the U-S-U range.</p>

<p>You will go in the house and he will begin to explain;<br>
You will see some blankets rolled up on the floor;<br>
You may ask what it is and they will tell you out plain<br>
That it is the bedding on the U-S-U range.</p>

<p>You <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span> are up in the morning at the daybreak<br>
To eat cold beef and U-S-U steak,<br>
And out to your work no matter if it's rain,&mdash;<br>
And that is the life on the U-S-U range.</p>

<p>You work hard all day and come in at night,<br>
And turn your horse loose, for they say it's all right,<br>
And set down to supper and begin to complain<br>
Of the chuck that you eat on the U-S-U range.</p>

<p>The grub that you get is beans and cold rice<br>
And U-S-U steak cooked up very nice;<br>
And if you don't like that you needn't complain,<br>
For that's what you get on the U-S-U range.</p>

<p>Now, kind friends, I must leave you, I no longer can remain,<br>
I hope I have pleased you and given you no pain.<br>
But when I am gone, don't think me strange,<br>
For I have been a cow-puncher on the U-S-U range.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm a good old rebel, that's what I am;<br>
And for this land of freedom, I don't care a damn,<br>
I'm glad I fought agin her, I only wish we'd won,<br>
And I don't axe any pardon for anything I've done.</p>

<p>I served with old Bob Lee, three years about,<br>
Got wounded in four places and starved at Point Lookout;<br>
I caught the rheumatism a-campin' in the snow,<br>
But I killed a <i>chance</i> of Yankees and wish I'd killed some mo'.</p>

<p class="add4em">For I'm a good old rebel, etc.</p>

<p>I hate the constitooshin, this great republic too;<br>
I hate the mouty eagle, an' the uniform so blue;<br>
I hate their glorious banner, an' all their flags an' fuss,<br>
Those lyin', thievin' Yankees, I hate 'em wuss an' wuss.</p>

<p class="add4em">For I'm a good old rebel, etc.</p>

<p>I won't be re-constructed! I'm better now than them;<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> for a carpet-bagger, I don't give a damn;<br>

<p>All day long on the prairies I ride,<br>
Not even a dog to trot by my side;<br>
My fire I kindle with chips gathered round,<br>
My coffee I boil without being ground.</p>

<p>I wash in a pool and wipe on a sack;<br>
I carry my wardrobe all on my back;<br>
For want of an oven I cook bread in a pot,<br>
And sleep on the ground for want of a cot.</p>

<p>My ceiling is the sky, my floor is the grass,<br>
My music is the lowing of the herds as they pass;<br>
My books are the brooks, my sermons the stones,<br>
My parson is a wolf on his pulpit of bones.</p>

<p>And then if my cooking is not very complete<br>
You can't blame me for wanting to eat.<br>
But show me a man that sleeps more profound<br>
Than the big puncher-boy who stretches himself on the ground.</p>

<p>My books teach me ever consistence to prize,<br>
My sermons, that small things I should not despise;<br>
My parson remarks from his pulpit of bones<br>
That fortune favors those who look out for their own.</p>

<p>And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> then between me and love lies a gulf very wide.<br>
Some lucky fellow may call her his bride.<br>
My friends gently hint I am coming to grief,<br>
But men must make money and women have beef.</p>

<p>But Cupid is always a friend to the bold,<br>
And the best of his arrows are pointed with gold.<br>
Society bans me so savage and dodge<br>
That the Masons would ball me out of their lodge.</p>

<p>If I had hair on my chin, I might pass for the goat<br>
That bore all the sins in the ages remote;<br>
But why it is I can never understand,<br>
For each of the patriarchs owned a big brand.</p>

<p>Abraham emigrated in search of a range,<br>
And when water was scarce he wanted a change;<br>
Old Isaac owned cattle in charge of Esau,<br>
And Jacob punched cows for his father-in-law.</p>

<p>He started in business way down at bed rock,<br>
And made quite a streak at handling stock;<br>
Then David went from night-herding to using a sling;<br>
And, winning the battle, he became a great king.<br>
Then the shepherds, while herding the sheep on a hill,<br>
Got a message from heaven of peace and goodwill.</p>

<p class="tit-song">BILL PETERS, THE STAGE DRIVER <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span></p>

<p>Bill Peters was a hustler<br>
From Independence town;<br>
He warn't a college scholar<br>
Nor man of great renown,<br>
But Bill had a way o' doing things<br>
And doin' 'em up brown.</p>

<p>Bill driv the stage from Independence<br>
Up to the Smokey Hill;<br>
And everybody knowed him thar<br>
As Independence Bill,&mdash;<br>
Thar warn't no feller on the route<br>
That driv with half the skill.</p>

<p>Bill driv four pair of horses,<br>
Same as you'd drive a team,<br>
And you'd think you was a-travelin'<br>
On a railroad driv by steam;<br>
And he'd git thar on time, you bet,<br>
Or Bill 'u'd bust a seam.</p>

<p>He carried mail and passengers,<br>
And he started on the dot,<br>
And them teams o' his'n, so they say,<br>
Was never known to trot;<br>
But they went it in a gallop<br>
And kept their axles hot.</p>

<p>When <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> Bill's stage 'u'd bust a tire,<br>
Or something 'u'd break down,<br>
He'd hustle round and patch her up<br>
And start off with a bound;<br>
And the wheels o' that old shack o' his<br>
Scarce ever touched the ground.</p>

<p>And Bill didn't low no foolin',<br>
And when Inguns hove in sight<br>
And bullets rattled at the stage,<br>
He druv with all his might;<br>
He'd holler, "Fellers, give 'em hell,<br>
I ain't got time to fight."</p>

<p>Then the way them wheels 'u'd rattle,<br>
And the way the dust 'u'd fly,<br>
You'd think a million cattle,<br>
Had stampeded and gone by;<br>
But the mail 'u'd get thar just the same,<br>
If the horses had to die.</p>

<p>He driv that stage for many a year<br>
Along the Smokey Hill,<br>
And a pile o' wild Comanches<br>
Did Bill Peters have to kill,&mdash;<br>
And I reckon if he'd had good luck<br>
He'd been a drivin' still.</p>

<p>But he chanced one day to run agin<br>
A bullet made o' lead,<br>
Which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> was harder than he bargained for<br>
And now poor Bill is dead;<br>
And when they brung his body home<br>
A barrel of tears was shed.</p>


<p class="tit-song">HARD TIMES <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span></p>

<p>Come listen a while and I'll sing you a song<br>
Concerning the times&mdash;it will not be long&mdash;<br>
When everybody is striving to buy,<br>
And cheating each other, I cannot tell why,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>From father to mother, from sister to brother,<br>
From cousin to cousin, they're cheating each other.<br>
Since cheating has grown to be so much the fashion,<br>
I believe to my soul it will run the whole Nation,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>Now there is the talker, by talking he eats,<br>
And so does the butcher by killing his meats.<br>
He'll toss the steelyards, and weigh it right down,<br>
And swear it's just right if it lacks forty pounds,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>And there is the merchant, as honest, we're told.<br>
Whatever he sells you, my friend, you are sold;<br>
Believe what I tell you, and don't be surprised<br>
To find yourself cheated half out of your eyes,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> there is the lawyer you plainly will see,<br>
He will plead your case for a very large fee,<br>
He'll law you and tell you the wrong side is right,<br>
And make you believe that a black horse is white,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>And there is the doctor, I like to forgot,<br>
I believe to my soul he's the worst of the lot;<br>
He'll tell you he'll cure you for half you possess,<br>
And when you're buried he'll take all the rest,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>And there's the old bachelor, all hated with scorn,<br>
He's like an old garment all tattered and torn,<br>
The girls and the widows all toss him a sigh,<br>
And think it quite right, and so do I,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>And there's the young widow, coquettish and shy,<br>
With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye,<br>
But when she gets married she'll cut quite a dash,<br>
She'll give him the reins and she'll handle the cash,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>And there's the young lady I like to have missed,<br>
And I believe to my soul she'd like to be kissed;<br>
She'll tell you she loves you with all pretence<br>
And ask you to call again some time hence,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

<p>And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> there's the young man, the worst of the whole.<br>
Oh, he will tell you with all of his soul,<br>
He'll tell you he loves you and for you will die,<br>
And when he's away he will swear it's a lie,&mdash;<br>
And it's hard, hard times.</p>

My crimes and depredations have brought my friends to shame;<br>
The robbing of the Northfield Bank, the same I can't deny,<br>
For now I am a prisoner, in the Stillwater jail I lie.</p>

<p>'Tis of a bold, high robbery, a story to you I'll tell,<br>
Of a California miner who unto us befell;<br>
We robbed him of his money and bid him go his way,<br>
For which I will be sorry until my dying day.</p>

<p>And then we started homeward, when brother Bob did say:<br>
"Now, Cole, we will buy fast horses and on them ride away.<br>
We will ride to avenge our father's death and try to win the prize;<br>
We will fight those anti-guerrillas until the day we die."</p>

<p>And then we rode towards Texas, that good old Lone Star State,<br>
But on Nebraska's prairies the James boys we did meet;<br>
With <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> knives, guns, and revolvers we all sat down to play,<br>
A-drinking of good whiskey to pass the time away.</p>

And the crimes done by our bloody hands bring tears into my eyes.<br>
The engineerman and fireman killed, the conductor escaped alive,<br>
And now their bones lie mouldering beneath Nebraska's skies.</p>

<p>Then we saddled horses, northwestward we did go,<br>
To the God-forsaken country called Min-ne-so-te-o;<br>
I had my eye on the Northfield bank when brother Bob did say,<br>
"Now, Cole, if you undertake the job, you will surely curse the day."</p>

<p>But I stationed out my pickets and up to the bank did go,<br>
And there upon the counter I struck my fatal blow.<br>
"Just hand us over your money and make no further delay,<br>
We are the famous Younger brothers, we spare no time to pray."</p>

<p class="tit-song">JOHN GARNER'S TRAIL HERD <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span></p>

<p>Come all you old timers and listen to my song;<br>
I'll make it short as possible and I'll not keep you long;<br>
I'll relate to you about the time you all remember well<br>
When we, with old Joe Garner, drove a beef herd up the trail.</p>

<p>When we left the ranch it was early in the spring,<br>
We had as good a corporal as ever rope did swing,<br>
Good hands and good horses, good outfit through and through,&mdash;<br>
We went well equipped, we were a jolly crew.</p>

<p>We had no little herd&mdash;two thousand head or more&mdash;<br>
And some as wild a brush beeves as you ever saw before.<br>
We swung to them all the way and sometimes by the tail,&mdash;<br>
Oh, you know we had a circus as we all went up the trail.</p>

<p>All things went on well till we reached the open ground,<br>
And then them cattle turned in and they gave us merry hell.<br>
They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> stampeded every night that came and did it without fail,&mdash;<br>
Oh, you know we had a circus as we all went up the trail.</p>

<p>We would round them up at morning and the boss would make a count,<br>
And say, "Look here, old punchers, we are out quite an amount;<br>
You must make all losses good and do it without fail<br>
Or you will never get another job of driving up the trail."</p>

<p>When we reached Red River we gave the Inspector the dodge.<br>
He swore by God Almighty, in jail old John should lodge.<br>
We told him if he'd taken our boss and had him locked in jail,<br>
We would shore get his scalp as we all came down the trail.</p>

<p>When we reached the Reservation, how squirmish we did feel,<br>
Although we had tried old Garner and knew him true as steel.<br>
And if we would follow him and do as he said do,<br>
That old bald-headed cow-thief would surely take us through.</p>

<p>When <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span> we reached Dodge City we drew our four months' pay.<br>
Times was better then, boys, that was a better day.<br>
The way we drank and gambled and threw the girls around,&mdash;<br>
"Say, a crowd of Texas cowboys has come to take our town."</p>

<p>The cowboy sees many hardships although he takes them well;<br>
The fun we had upon that trip, no human tongue can tell.<br>
The cowboy's life is a dreary life, though his mind it is no load,<br>
And he always spends his money like he found it in the road.</p>

<p>If ever you meet old Garner, you must meet him on the square,<br>
For he is the biggest cow-thief that ever tramped out there.<br>
But if you want to hear him roar and spin a lively tale,<br>
Just ask him about the time we all went up the trail.</p>

<p>Come all of you, my brother scouts,<br>
And join me in my song;<br>
Come, let us sing together<br>
Though the shadows fall so long.</p>

<p>Of all the old frontiersmen<br>
That used to scour the plain,<br>
There are but very few of them<br>
That with us yet remain.</p>

<p>Day after day they're dropping off,<br>
They're going one by one;<br>
Our clan is fast decreasing,<br>
Our race is almost run.</p>

<p>There were many of our number<br>
That never wore the blue,<br>
But, faithfully, they did their part,<br>
As brave men, tried and true.</p>

<p>They never joined the army,<br>
But had other work to do<br>
In piloting the coming folks,<br>
To help them safely through.</p>

<p>But, brothers, we are falling,<br>
Our race is almost run;<br>
The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> days of elk and buffalo<br>
And beaver traps are gone.</p>

<p>Oh, the days of elk and buffalo!<br>
It fills my heart with pain<br>
To know these days are past and gone<br>
To never come again.</p>

<p>We fought the red-skin rascals<br>
Over valley, hill, and plain;<br>
We fought him in the mountain top,<br>
And fought him down again.</p>

<p>These fighting days are over;<br>
The Indian yell resounds<br>
No more along the border;<br>
Peace sends far sweeter sounds.</p>

<p>But we found great joy, old comrades,<br>
To hear, and make it die;<br>
We won bright homes for gentle ones,<br>
And now, our West, good-bye.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE LONE BUFFALO HUNTER <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span></p>

<p>It's of those Texas cowboys, a story I'll tell;<br>
No name I will mention though in Texas they do dwell.<br>
Go find them where you will, they are all so very brave,<br>
And when in good society they seldom misbehave.</p>

<p>When the fall work is all over in the line-camp they'll be found,<br>
For they have to ride those lonesome lines the long winter round;<br>
They prove loyal to a comrade, no matter what's to do;<br>
And when in love with a fair one they seldom prove untrue.</p>

<p>But springtime comes at last and finds them glad and gay;<br>
They ride out to the round-up about the first of May;<br>
About the first of August they start up the trail,<br>
They have to stay with the cattle, no matter rain or hail.</p>

<p>But when they get to the shipping point, then they receive their tens,<br>
Straightway to the bar-room and gently blow them in;<br>
It's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> the height of their ambition, so I've been truly told,<br>
To ride good horses and saddles and spend the silver and gold.</p>

<p>Those last two things I've mentioned, it is their heart's desire,<br>
And when they leave the shipping point, their eyes are like balls of fire.<br>
It's of those fighting cattle, they seem to have no fear,<br>
A-riding bucking broncos oft is their heart's desire.</p>

<p>They will ride into the branding pen, a rope within their hands,<br>
They will catch them by each forefoot and bring them to the sands;<br>
It's altogether in practice with a little bit of sleight,<br>
A-roping Texas cattle, it is their heart's delight.</p>

<p>But now comes the rising generation to take the cowboy's place,<br>
Likewise the corn-fed granger, with his bold and cheeky face;<br>
It's on those plains of Texas a lone buffalo hunter does stand<br>
To tell the fate of the cowboy that rode at his right hand.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE CROOKED TRAIL TO HOLBROOK <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span></p>

<p>Come all you jolly cowboys that follow the bronco steer,<br>
I'll sing to you a verse or two your spirits for to cheer;<br>
It's all about a trip, a trip that I did undergo<br>
On that crooked trail to Holbrook, in Arizona oh.</p>

<p>It's on the seventeenth of February, our herd it started out,<br>
It would have made your hearts shudder to hear them bawl and shout,<br>
As wild as any buffalo that ever rode the Platte,<br>
Those dogies we were driving, and every one was fat.</p>

<p>We crossed the Mescal Mountains on the way to Gilson Flats,<br>
And when we got to Gilson Flats, Lord, how the wind did blow;<br>
It blew so hard, it blew so fierce, we knew not where to go,<br>
But our spirits never failed us as onward we did go,&mdash;<br>
On that crooked trail to Holbrook, in Arizona oh.</p>

<p>That night we had a stampede; Christ, how the cattle run!<br>
We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> made it to our horses; I tell you, we had no fun;<br>
Over the prickly pear and catclaw brush we quickly made our way;<br>
We thought of our long journey and the girls we'd left one day.</p>

<p>It's long by Sombserva we slowly punched along,<br>
While each and every puncher would sing a hearty song<br>
To cheer up his comrade as onward we did go,<br>
On that crooked trail to Holbrook, in Arizona oh.</p>

<p>We crossed the Mongollen Mountains where the tall pines do grow,<br>
Grass grows in abundance, and rippling streams do flow;<br>
Our packs were always turning, of course our gait was slow,<br>
On that crooked trail to Holbrook, in Arizona oh.</p>

<p>At last we got to Holbrook, a little gale did blow;<br>
It blew up sand and pebble stones and it didn't blow them slow.<br>
We had to drink the water from that muddy little stream<br>
And swallowed a peck of dirt when we tried to eat a bean.</p>

<p>But the cattle now are shipped and homeward we are bound<br>
With <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> a lot of as tired horses as ever could be found;<br>
Across the reservation no danger did we fear,<br>
But thought of wives and sweethearts and the ones we love so dear.<br>
Now we are back in Globe City, our friendship there to share;<br>
Here's luck to every puncher that follows the bronco steer.</p>

It was in Western Texas on the old N A range<br>
The boy fell a victim on the old staked plains.</p>

<p class="add1em">He was only a cowboy gone on before,<br>

The boys were like brothers, their friendship was great,<br>
When "O God, have mercy" was heard from behind,&mdash;<br>
The cattle were left to drift on the line.</p>

<p>He leaves a dear wife and little ones, too,<br>
To earn them a living, as fathers oft do;<br>
For while he was working for the loved ones so dear<br>
He was took without warning or one word of cheer.</p>

<p>And while he is sleeping where the sun always shines,<br>
The boys they go dashing along on the line;<br>
The look on their faces it speaks to us all<br>
Of one who departed to the home of the soul.</p>

<p>He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> was only a cowboy gone on before,<br>

<p>Ye sons of Columbia, your attention I do crave,<br>
While a sorrowful story I do tell,<br>
Which happened of late, in the Indiana state,<br>
And a hero not many could excel;<br>
Like Samson he courted, made choice of the fair,<br>
And intended to make her his wife;<br>
But she, like Delilah, his heart did ensnare,<br>
Which cost him his honor and his life.</p>

<p>A gold ring he gave her in token of his love,<br>
On the face was the image of the dove;<br>
They mutually agreed to get married with speed<br>
And were promised by the powers above.<br>
But the fickle-minded maiden vowed again to wed<br>
To young Warren who lived in that place;<br>
It was a fatal blow that caused his overthrow<br>
And added to her shame and disgrace.</p>

<p>When Fuller came to hear he was deprived of his dear<br>
Whom he vowed by the powers to wed,<br>
With his heart full of woe unto Warren he did go,<br>
And smilingly unto him he said:<br>
"Young man, you have injured me to gratify your cause<br>
By reporting that I left a prudent wife;<br>
Acknowledge <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> now that you have wronged me, for although I break the laws,<br>
Young Warren, I'll deprive you of your life."</p>

<p>Then Warren, he replied: "Your request must be denied,<br>
For your darling to my heart she is bound;<br>
And further I can say that this is our wedding day,<br>
In spite of all the heroes in town."<br>
Then Fuller in the passion of his love and anger bound,&mdash;<br>
Alas! it caused many to cry,&mdash;<br>
At one fatal shot killed Warren on the spot,<br>
And smilingly said, "I'm ready now to die."</p>

<p>The time was drawing nigh when Fuller had to die;<br>
He bid the audience adieu.<br>
Like an angel he did stand, for he was a handsome man,<br>
On his breast he had a ribbon of blue.<br>
Ten thousand spectators did smite him on the breast,<br>
And the guards dropped a tear from the eye,<br>
Saying, "Cursed be she who caused this misery,<br>
Would to God in his stead she had to die."</p>

<p>The gentle god of Love looked with anger from above<br>
And the rope flew asunder like the sand.<br>
Two doctors for the pay they murdered him, they say,<br>
They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> hung him by main strength of hand.<br>
But the corpse it was buried and the doctors lost their prey,<br>
Oh, that harlot was bribed, I do believe;<br>
Bad women to a certainty are the downfall of men,<br>
As Adam was beguiled by Eve.</p>

<p>I made up my mind to change my way<br>
And quit my crowd that was so gay,<br>
To leave my native home for a while<br>
And to travel west for many a mile.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>'Twas all in the merry month of May<br>
When I started for Texas far away,<br>
I left my darling girl behind,&mdash;<br>
She said her heart was only mine.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>Oh, it was when I embraced her in my arms<br>
I thought she had ten thousand charms;<br>
Her caresses were soft, her kisses were sweet,<br>
Saying, "We will get married next time we meet."</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>It was in the year of eighty-three<br>
That A.J. Stinson hired me.<br>
He says, "Young fellow, I want you to go<br>
And drive this herd to Mexico."</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span> first horse they gave me was an old black<br>
With two big set-fasts on his back;<br>
I padded him with gunny-sacks and my bedding all;<br>
He went up, then down, and I got a fall.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>The next they gave me was an old gray,<br>
I'll remember him till my dying day.<br>
And if I had to swear to the fact,<br>
I believe he was worse off than the black.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>Oh, it was early in the year<br>
When I went on trail to drive the steer.<br>
I stood my guard through sleet and snow<br>
While on the trail to Mexico.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>Oh, it was a long and lonesome go<br>
As our herd rolled on to Mexico;<br>
With laughter light and the cowboy's song<br>
To Mexico we rolled along.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Mexico<br>
I wanted to see my love but could not go;<br>
So <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span> I wrote a letter, a letter to my dear,<br>
But not a word from her could I hear.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the once loved home<br>
I called for the darling of my own;<br>
They said she had married a richer life,<br>
Therefore, wild cowboy, seek another wife.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>Oh, the girl she is married I do adore,<br>
And I cannot stay at home any more;<br>
I'll cut my way to a foreign land<br>
Or I'll go back west to my cowboy band.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>I'll go back to the Western land,<br>
I'll hunt up my old cowboy band,&mdash;<br>
Where the girls are few and the boys are true<br>
And a false-hearted love I never knew.</p>

<p>Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.</p>

<p>"O Buddie, O Buddie, please stay at home,<br>
Don't be forever on the roam.<br>
There is many a girl more true than I,<br>

<p class="tit-song">THE HORSE WRANGLER <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span></p>

<p>I thought one spring just for fun<br>
I'd see how cow-punching was done,<br>
And when the round-ups had begun<br>
I tackled the cattle-king.<br>
Says he, "My foreman is in town,<br>
He's at the plaza, and his name is Brown,<br>
If you'll see him, he'll take you down."<br>
Says I, "That's just the thing."</p>

<p>We started for the ranch next day;<br>
Brown augured me most all the way.<br>
He said that cow-punching was nothing but play,<br>
That it was no work at all,&mdash;<br>
That all you had to do was ride,<br>
And only drifting with the tide;<br>
The son of a gun, oh, how he lied.<br>
Don't you think he had his gall?</p>

<p>He put me in charge of a cavyard,<br>
And told me not to work too hard,<br>
That all I had to do was guard<br>
The horses from getting away;<br>
I had one hundred and sixty head,<br>
I sometimes wished that I was dead;<br>
When one got away, Brown's head turned red,<br>
And there was the devil to pay.</p>

<p>Sometimes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span> one would make a break,<br>
Across the prairie he would take,<br>
As if running for a stake,&mdash;<br>
It seemed to them but play;<br>
Sometimes I could not head them at all,<br>
Sometimes my horse would catch a fall<br>
And I'd shoot on like a cannon ball<br>
Till the earth came in my way.</p>

<p>They saddled me up an old gray hack<br>
With two set-fasts on his back,<br>
They padded him down with a gunny sack<br>
And used my bedding all.<br>
When I got on he quit the ground,<br>
Went up in the air and turned around,<br>
And I came down and busted the ground,&mdash;<br>
I got one hell of a fall.</p>

<p>They took me up and carried me in<br>
And rubbed me down with an old stake pin.<br>
"That's the way they all begin;<br>
You're doing well," says Brown.<br>
"And in the morning, if you don't die,<br>
I'll give you another horse to try."<br>
"Oh say, can't I walk?" says I.<br>
Says he, "Yes, back to town."</p>

<p>I've traveled up and I've traveled down,<br>
I've traveled this country round and round,<br>
I've lived in city and I've lived in town,<br>
But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span> I've got this much to say:<br>
Before you try cow-punching, kiss your wife,<br>
Take a heavy insurance on your life,<br>
Then cut your throat with a barlow knife,&mdash;<br>
For it's easier done that way.</p>


<p class="tit-song">CALIFORNIA JOE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span></p>

<p>Well, mates, I don't like stories;<br>
Or am I going to act<br>
A part around the campfire<br>
That ain't a truthful fact?<br>
So fill your pipes and listen,<br>
I'll tell you&mdash;let me see&mdash;<br>
I think it was in fifty,<br>
From that till sixty-three.</p>

<p>You've all heard tell of Bridger;<br>
I used to run with Jim,<br>
And many a hard day's scouting<br>
I've done longside of him.<br>
Well, once near old Fort Reno,<br>
A trapper used to dwell;<br>
We called him old Pap Reynolds,<br>
The scouts all knew him well.</p>

<p>One night in the spring of fifty<br>
We camped on Powder River,<br>
And killed a calf of buffalo<br>
And cooked a slice of liver.<br>
While eating, quite contented,<br>
I heard three shots or four;<br>
Put out the fire and listened,&mdash;<br>
We heard a dozen more.</p>

<p>We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> knew that old man Reynolds<br>
Had moved his traps up here;<br>
So picking up our rifles<br>
And fixing on our gear<br>
We moved as quick as lightning,<br>
To save was our desire.<br>
Too late, the painted heathens<br>
Had set the house on fire.</p>

<p>We hitched our horses quickly<br>
And waded up the stream;<br>
While down close beside the waters<br>
I heard a muffled scream.<br>
And there among the bushes<br>
A little girl did lie.<br>
I picked her up and whispered,<br>
"I'll save you or I'll die."</p>

<p>Lord, what a ride! Old Bridger<br>
Had covered my retreat;<br>
Sometimes that child would whisper<br>
In voice low and sweet,<br>
"Poor Papa, God will take him<br>
To Mama up above;<br>
There is no one left to love me,<br>
There is no one left to love."</p>

<p>The little one was thirteen<br>
And I was twenty-two;<br>
I says, "I'll be your father<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> love you just as true."<br>
She nestled to my bosom,<br>
Her hazel eyes so bright,<br>
Looked up and made me happy,&mdash;<br>
The close pursuit that night.</p>

<p>One month had passed and Maggie,<br>
We called her Hazel Eye,<br>
In truth was going to leave me,<br>
Was going to say good-bye.<br>
Her uncle, Mad Jack Reynolds,<br>
Reported long since dead,<br>
Had come to claim my angel,<br>
His brother's child, he said.</p>

<p>What could I say? We parted,<br>
Mad Jack was growing old;<br>
I handed him a bank note<br>
And all I had in gold.<br>
They rode away at sunrise,<br>
I went a mile or two,<br>
And parting says, "We will meet again;<br>
May God watch over you."</p>

<p>By a laughing, dancing brook<br>
A little cabin stood,<br>
And weary with a long day's scout,<br>
I spied it in the wood.<br>
The pretty valley stretched beyond,<br>
The mountains towered above,<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> near its willow banks I heard<br>
The cooing of a dove.</p>

<p>'Twas one grand pleasure;<br>
The brook was plainly seen,<br>
Like a long thread of silver<br>
In a cloth of lovely green;<br>
The laughter of the water,<br>
The cooing of the dove,<br>
Was like some painted picture,<br>
Some well-told tale of love.</p>

<p>While drinking in the country<br>
And resting in the saddle,<br>
I heard a gentle rippling<br>
Like the dipping of a paddle,<br>
And turning to the water,<br>
A strange sight met my view,&mdash;<br>
A lady with her rifle<br>
In a little bark canoe.</p>

<p>She stood up in the center,<br>
With her rifle to her eye;<br>
I thought just for a second<br>
My time had come to die.<br>
I doffed my hat and told her,<br>
If it was just the same,<br>
To drop her little shooter,<br>
For I was not her game.</p>

<p>She <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> dropped the deadly weapon<br>
And leaped from the canoe.<br>
Says she, "I beg your pardon;<br>
I thought you was a Sioux.<br>
Your long hair and your buckskin<br>
Looked warrior-like and rough;<br>
My bead was spoiled by sunshine,<br>
Or I'd have killed you sure enough."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would've been better<br>
If you'd dropped me then," says I;<br>
"For surely such an angel<br>
Would bear me to the sky."<br>
She blushingly dropped her eyelids,<br>
Her cheeks were crimson red;<br>
One half-shy glance she gave me<br>
And then hung down her head.</p>

<p>I took her little hand in mine;<br>
She wondered what it meant,<br>
And yet she drew it not away,<br>
But rather seemed content.<br>
We sat upon the mossy bank,<br>
Her eyes began to fill;<br>
The brook was rippling at our feet,<br>
The dove was cooing still.</p>

<p>'Tis strong arms were thrown around her.<br>
"I'll save you or I'll die."<br>
I clasped her to my bosom,<br>
My <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> long lost Hazel Eye.<br>
The rapture of that moment<br>
Was almost heaven to me;<br>
I kissed her 'mid the tear-drops,<br>
Her merriment and glee.</p>

<p>Her heart near mine was beating<br>
When sobbingly she said,<br>
"My dear, my brave preserver,<br>
They told me you were dead.<br>
But oh, those parting words, Joe,<br>
Have never left my mind,<br>
You said, 'We'll meet again, Mag,'<br>
Then rode off like the wind.</p>

<p>"And oh, how I have prayed, Joe,<br>
For you who saved my life,<br>
That God would send an angel<br>
To guide you through all strife.<br>
The one who claimed me from you,<br>
My Uncle, good and true,<br>
Is sick in yonder cabin;<br>
Has talked so much of you.</p>

<p>"'If Joe were living darling,'<br>
He said to me last night,<br>
'He would care for you, Maggie,<br>
When God puts out my light.'"<br>
We found the old man sleeping.<br>
"Hush, Maggie, let him rest."<br>
The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> sun was slowly setting<br>
In the far-off, glowing West.</p>

<p>And though we talked in whispers<br>
He opened wide his eyes:<br>
"A dream, a dream," he murmured;<br>
"Alas, a dream of lies."<br>
She drifted like a shadow<br>
To where the old man lay.<br>
"You had a dream, dear Uncle,<br>
Another dream to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I saw an angel<br>
As pure as mountain snow,<br>
And near her at my bedside<br>
Stood California Joe."<br>
"I'm sure I'm not an angel,<br>
Dear Uncle, that you know;<br>
These hands that hold your hand, too,<br>
My face is not like snow.</p>

<p>"Now listen while I tell you,<br>
For I have news to cheer;<br>
Hazel Eye is happy,<br>
For Joe is truly here."<br>
It was but a few days after<br>
The old man said to me,<br>
"Joe, boy, she is an angel,<br>
And good as angels be.</p>

<p>"For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> three long months she hunted,<br>
And trapped and nursed me too;<br>
God bless you, boy, I believe it,<br>
She's safe along with you."<br>
The sun was slowly sinking,<br>
When Maggie, my wife, and I<br>
Went riding through the valley,<br>
The tear-drops in her eye.</p>

<p>"One year ago to-day, Joe,<br>
I saw the mossy grave;<br>
We laid him neath the daisies,<br>
My Uncle, good and brave."<br>
And comrade, every springtime<br>
Is sure to find me there;<br>
There is something in the valley<br>
That is always fresh and fair.</p>

<p>Our love is always kindled<br>
While sitting by the stream,<br>
Where two hearts were united<br>
In love's sweet happy dream.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE BOSTON BURGLAR <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span></p>

<p>I was born in Boston City, a city you all know well,<br>
Brought up by honest parents, the truth to you I'll tell,<br>
Brought up by honest parents and raised most tenderly,<br>
Till I became a roving man at the age of twenty-three.</p>

<p>My character was taken then, and I was sent to jail.<br>
My friends they found it was in vain to get me out on bail.<br>
The jury found me guilty, the clerk he wrote it down,<br>
The judge he passed me sentence and I was sent to Charleston town.</p>

<p>You ought to have seen my aged father a-pleading at the bar,<br>
Also my dear old mother a-tearing of her hair,<br>
Tearing of her old gray locks as the tears came rolling down,<br>
Saying, "Son, dear son, what have you done, that you are sent to Charleston town?"</p>

<p>They put me aboard an eastbound train one cold December day,<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> every station that we passed, I'd hear the people say,<br>
"There goes a noted burglar, in strong chains he'll be bound,&mdash;<br>
For the doing of some crime or other he is sent to Charleston town."</p>

<p>There is a girl in Boston, she is a girl that I love well,<br>
And if I ever gain my liberty, along with her I'll dwell;<br>
And when I regain my liberty, bad company I will shun,<br>
Night-walking, gambling, and also drinking rum.</p>

<p>Now, you who have your liberty, pray keep it if you can,<br>
And don't go around the streets at night to break the laws of man;<br>
For if you do you'll surely rue and find yourself like me,<br>
A-serving out my twenty-one years in the penitentiary.</p>


<p class="tit-song">SAM BASS <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span></p>

<p>Sam Bass was born in Indiana, it was his native home,<br>
And at the age of seventeen young Sam began to roam.<br>
Sam first came out to Texas a cowboy for to be,&mdash;<br>
A kinder-hearted fellow you seldom ever see.</p>

<p>Sam used to deal in race stock, one called the Denton mare,<br>
He matched her in scrub races, and took her to the Fair.<br>
Sam used to coin the money and spent it just as free,<br>
He always drank good whiskey wherever he might be.</p>

<p>Sam left the Collin's ranch in the merry month of May<br>
With a herd of Texas cattle the Black Hills for to see,<br>
Sold out in Custer City and then got on a spree,&mdash;<br>
A harder set of cowboys you seldom ever see.</p>

<p>On their way back to Texas they robbed the U.P. train,<br>
And then split up in couples and started out again.<br>
Joe Collins and his partner were overtaken soon,<br>
With all their hard-earned money they had to meet their doom.</p>

<p>Sam <span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span> made it back to Texas all right side up with care;<br>
Rode into the town of Denton with all his friends to share.<br>
Sam's life was short in Texas; three robberies did he do,<br>
He robbed all the passenger, mail, and express cars too.</p>

<p>Sam had four companions&mdash;four bold and daring lads&mdash;<br>
They were Richardson, Jackson, Joe Collins, and Old Dad;<br>
Four more bold and daring cowboys the rangers never knew,<br>
They whipped the Texas rangers and ran the boys in blue.</p>

<p>Sam had another companion, called Arkansas for short,<br>
Was shot by a Texas ranger by the name of Thomas Floyd;<br>
Oh, Tom is a big six-footer and thinks he's mighty fly,<br>
But I can tell you his racket,&mdash;he's a deadbeat on the sly.</p>

<p>Jim Murphy was arrested, and then released on bail;<br>
He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span> jumped his bond at Tyler and then took the train for Terrell;<br>
But Mayor Jones had posted Jim and that was all a stall,<br>
'Twas only a plan to capture Sam before the coming fall.</p>

<p>Sam met his fate at Round Rock, July the twenty-first,<br>
They pierced poor Sam with rifle balls and emptied out his purse.<br>
Poor Sam he is a corpse and six foot under clay,<br>
And Jackson's in the bushes trying to get away.</p>

<p>Jim had borrowed Sam's good gold and didn't want to pay,<br>
The only shot he saw was to give poor Sam away.<br>
He sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to mourn,&mdash;<br>
Oh, what a scorching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn.</p>

<p>And so he sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to mourn,<br>
Oh, what a scorching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn.<br>
Perhaps he's got to heaven, there's none of us can say,<br>
But if I'm right in my surmise he's gone the other way.</p>

<p class="tit-song">THE ZEBRA DUN <span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span></p>

<p>We were camped on the plains at the head of the Cimarron<br>
When along came a stranger and stopped to arger some.<br>
He looked so very foolish that we began to look around,<br>
We thought he was a greenhorn that had just 'scaped from town.</p>

<p>We asked if he had been to breakfast; he hadn't had a smear,<br>
So we opened up the chuck-box and bade him have his share.<br>
He took a cup of coffee and some biscuits and some beans,<br>
And then began to talk and tell about foreign kings and queens,&mdash;</p>

<p>About the Spanish war and fighting on the seas<br>
With guns as big as steers and ramrods big as trees,&mdash;<br>
And about old Paul Jones, a mean, fighting son of a gun,<br>
Who was the grittiest cuss that ever pulled a gun.</p>

<p>Such an educated feller his thoughts just came in herds,<br>
He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span> astonished all them cowboys with them jaw-breaking words.<br>
He just kept on talking till he made the boys all sick,<br>
And they began to look around just how to play a trick.</p>

<p>He said he had lost his job upon the Santa F√©<br>
And was going across the plains to strike the 7-D.<br>
He didn't say how come it, some trouble with the boss,<br>
But said he'd like to borrow a nice fat saddle hoss.</p>

<p>This tickled all the boys to death, they laughed way down in their sleeves,&mdash;<br>
"We will lend you a horse just as fresh and fat as you please."<br>
Shorty grabbed a lariat and roped the Zebra Dun<br>
And turned him over to the stranger and waited for the fun.</p>

<p>Old Dunny was a rocky outlaw that had grown so awful wild<br>
That he could paw the white out of the moon every jump for a mile.<br>
Old Dunny stood right still,&mdash;as if he didn't know,&mdash;<br>
Until he was saddled and ready for to go.</p>

<p>When the stranger hit the saddle, old Dunny quit the earth<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> traveled right straight up for all that he was worth.<br>
A-pitching and a-squealing, a-having wall-eyed fits,<br>
His hind feet perpendicular, his front ones in the bits.</p>

<p>We could see the tops of the mountains under Dunny every jump,<br>
But the stranger he was growed there just like the camel's hump;<br>
The stranger sat upon him and curled his black mustache<br>
Just like a summer boarder waiting for his hash.</p>

<p>He thumped him in the shoulders and spurred him when he whirled,<br>
To show them flunky punchers that he was the wolf of the world.<br>
When the stranger had dismounted once more upon the ground,<br>
We knew he was a thoroughbred and not a gent from town;</p>

<p>The boss who was standing round watching of the show,<br>
Walked right up to the stranger and told him he needn't go,&mdash;<br>
"If you can use the lasso like you rode old Zebra Dun,<br>
You <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> are the man I've been looking for ever since the year one."</p>

<p>Oh, he could twirl the lariat and he didn't do it slow,<br>
He could catch them fore feet nine out of ten for any kind of dough.<br>
And when the herd stampeded he was always on the spot<br>
And set them to nothing, like the boiling of a pot.</p>

<p>There's one thing and a shore thing I've learned since I've been born,<br>
That every educated feller ain't a plumb greenhorn.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE BUFFALO SKINNERS <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span></p>

<p>Come all you jolly fellows and listen to my song,<br>
There are not many verses, it will not detain you long;<br>
It's concerning some young fellows who did agree to go<br>
And spend one summer pleasantly on the range of the buffalo.</p>

<p>It happened in Jacksboro in the spring of seventy-three,<br>
A man by the name of Crego came stepping up to me,<br>
Saying, "How do you do, young fellow, and how would you like to go<br>
And spend one summer pleasantly on the range of the buffalo?"</p>

<p>"It's me being out of employment," this to Crego I did say,<br>
"This going out on the buffalo range depends upon the pay.<br>
But if you will pay good wages and transportation too,<br>
I think, sir, I will go with you to the range of the buffalo."</p>

<p>"Yes, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span> I will pay good wages, give transportation too,<br>
Provided you will go with me and stay the summer through;<br>
But if you should grow homesick, come back to Jacksboro,<br>
I won't pay transportation from the range of the buffalo."</p>

<p>It's now our outfit was complete&mdash;seven able-bodied men,<br>
With navy six and needle gun&mdash;our troubles did begin;<br>
Our way it was a pleasant one, the route we had to go,<br>
Until we crossed Pease River on the range of the buffalo.</p>

<p>It's now we've crossed Pease River, our troubles have begun.<br>
The first damned tail I went to rip, Christ! how I cut my thumb!<br>
While skinning the damned old stinkers our lives wasn't a show,<br>
For the Indians watched to pick us off while skinning the buffalo.</p>

<p>He fed us on such sorry chuck I wished myself most dead,<br>
It was old jerked beef, croton coffee, and sour bread.<br>
Pease <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> River's as salty as hell fire, the water I could never go,&mdash;<br>
O God! I wished I had never come to the range of the buffalo.</p>

<p>Our meat it was buffalo hump and iron wedge bread,<br>
And all we had to sleep on was a buffalo robe for a bed;<br>
The fleas and gray-backs worked on us, O boys, it was not slow,<br>
I'll tell you there's no worse hell on earth than the range of the buffalo.</p>

<p>Our hearts were cased with buffalo hocks, our souls were cased with steel,<br>
And the hardships of that summer would nearly make us reel.<br>
While skinning the damned old stinkers our lives they had no show,<br>
For the Indians waited to pick us off on the hills of Mexico.</p>

<p>The season being near over, old Crego he did say<br>
The crowd had been extravagant, was in debt to him that day,&mdash;<br>
We coaxed him and we begged him and still it was no go,&mdash;<br>
We left old Crego's bones to bleach on the range of the buffalo.</p>

<p>Oh, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> it's now we've crossed Pease River and homeward we are bound,<br>
No more in that hell-fired country shall ever we be found.<br>
Go home to our wives and sweethearts, tell others not to go,<br>
For God's forsaken the buffalo range and the damned old buffalo.</p>

<p>Now come young men and list to me,<br>
A sad and mournful history;<br>
And may you ne'er forgetful be<br>
Of what I tell this day to thee.</p>

<p>Oh, I was thoughtless, young, and gay<br>
And often broke the Sabbath day,<br>
In wickedness I took delight<br>
And sometimes done what wasn't right.</p>

<p>I'd scarcely passed my fifteenth year,<br>
My mother and my father dear<br>
Were silent in their deep, dark grave,<br>
Their spirits gone to Him who gave.</p>

<p>'Twas on a pleasant summer day<br>
When from my home I ran away<br>
And took unto myself a wife,<br>
Which step was fatal to my life.</p>

<p>Oh, she was kind and good to me<br>
As ever woman ought to be,<br>
And might this day have been alive no doubt,<br>
Had I not met Miss Hatty Stout.</p>

<p>Ah, well I mind the fatal day<br>
When Hatty stole my heart away;<br>
'Twas <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> love for her controlled my will<br>
And did cause me my wife to kill.</p>

<p>'Twas on a brilliant summer's night<br>
When all was still; the stars shone bright.<br>
My wife lay still upon the bed<br>
And I approached to her and said:</p>

<p>"Dear wife, here's medicine I've brought,<br>
For you this day, my love, I've bought.<br>
I know it will be good for you<br>
For those vile fits,&mdash;pray take it, do."</p>

<p>She cast on me a loving look<br>
And in her mouth the poison took;<br>
Down by her infant on the bed<br>
In her last, long sleep she laid her head.</p>

<p>Oh, who could tell a mother's thought<br>
When first to her the news was brought;<br>
The sheriff said her son was sought<br>
And into prison must be brought.</p>

<p>Only a mother standing by<br>
To hear them tell the reason why<br>
Her son in prison, he must lie<br>
Till on the scaffold he must die.</p>

<p>My father, sixty years of age,<br>
The best of counsel did engage,<br>
To <span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span> see if something could be done<br>
To save his disobedient son.</p>

<p>So, farewell, mother, do not weep,<br>
Though soon with demons I will sleep,<br>
My soul now feels its mental hell<br>
And soon with demons I will dwell.</p>

<hr class="small">

<p>The sheriff cut the slender cord,<br>
His soul went up to meet its Lord;<br>
The doctor said, "The wretch is dead,<br>
His spirit from his body's fled."</p>

<p>His weeping mother cried aloud,<br>
"O God, do save this gazing crowd,<br>
That none may ever have to pay<br>
For gambling on the Sabbath day."</p>


<p class="tit-song">LITTLE JOE, THE WRANGLER <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span></p>

<p>It's little Joe, the wrangler, he'll wrangle never more,<br>
His days with the <i>remuda</i> they are o'er;<br>
'Twas a year ago last April when he rode into our camp,&mdash;<br>
Just a little Texas stray and all alone,&mdash;<br>
On a little Texas pony he called "Chaw."<br>
With his brogan shoes and overalls, a tougher kid<br>
You never in your life before had saw.</p>

<p>His saddle was a Texas "kak," built many years ago,<br>
With an O.K. spur on one foot lightly swung;<br>
His "hot roll" in a cotton sack so loosely tied behind,<br>
And his canteen from his saddle-horn was swung.<br>
He said that he had to leave his home, his pa had married twice;<br>
And his new ma whipped him every day or two;<br>
So he saddled up old Chaw one night and lit a shuck this way,<br>
And he's now trying to paddle his own canoe.</p>

<p>He said if we would give him work, he'd do the best he could,<br>
Though he didn't know straight up about a cow;<br>
So <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> the boss he cut him out a mount and kindly put him on,<br>
For he sorta liked this little kid somehow.<br>
Learned him to wrangle horses and to try to know them all,<br>
And get them in at daylight if he could;<br>
To follow the chuck-wagon and always hitch the team,<br>
And to help the <i>cocinero</i> rustle wood.</p>

<p>We had driven to the Pecos, the weather being fine;<br>
We had camped on the south side in a bend;<br>
When a norther commenced blowin', we had doubled up our guard,<br>
For it taken all of us to hold them in.<br>
Little Joe, the wrangler, was called out with the rest;<br>
Though the kid had scarcely reached the herd,<br>
When the cattle they stampeded, like a hailstorm long they fled,<br>
Then we were all a-ridin' for the lead.</p>

<p>'Midst the streaks of lightin' a horse we could see in the lead,<br>
'Twas Little Joe, the wrangler, in the lead;<br>
He was riding Old Blue Rocket with a slicker o'er his head,<br>
A tryin' to check the cattle in their speed.<br>
At last we got them milling and kinda quieted down,<br>
And the extra guard back to the wagon went;<br>
But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> there was one a-missin' and we knew it at a glance,<br>
'Twas our little Texas stray, poor Wrangling Joe.</p>

<p>The next morning just at day break, we found where Rocket fell,<br>
Down in a washout twenty feet below;<br>
And beneath the horse, mashed to a pulp,&mdash;his spur had rung the knell,&mdash;<br>
Was our little Texas stray, poor Wrangling Joe.</p>

<p>Come all kind friends and kindred dear and Christians young and old,<br>
A story I'll relate to you, 'twill make your blood run cold;<br>
'Tis all about an unfortunate boy who lived not far from here,<br>
In the township of Arcade in the County of Lapeer.<br>
It seems his occupation was a sawyer in a mill,<br>
He followed it successfully two years, one month, until,<br>
Until this fatal accident that caused many to weep and wail;<br>
'Twas where this young man lost his life,&mdash;his name was Harry Bale.</p>

<p>On the 29th of April in the year of seventy-nine,<br>
He went to work as usual, no fear did he design;<br>
In lowering of the feed bar throwing the carriage into gear<br>
It brought him down upon the saw and cut him quite severe;<br>
It cut him through the collar-bone and half way down the back,<br>
It threw him down upon the saw, the carriage coming back.<br>
He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span> started for the shanty, his strength was failing fast;<br>
He said, "Oh, boys, I'm wounded: I fear it is my last."</p>

<p>His brothers they were sent for, likewise his sisters too,<br>
The doctors came and dressed his wound, but kind words proved untrue.<br>
Poor Harry had no father to weep beside his bed,<br>
No kind and loving mother to sooth his aching head.<br>
He was just as gallant a young man as ever you wished to know,<br>
But he withered like a flower, it was his time to go.</p>

<p>They placed him in his coffin and laid him in his grave;<br>
His brothers and sisters mourned the loss of a brother so true and brave.<br>
They took him to the graveyard and laid him away to rest,<br>
His body lies mouldering, his soul is among the blest.</p>


<p class="tit-song">FOREMAN MONROE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span></p>

<p>Come all you brave young shanty boys, and list while I relate<br>
Concerning a young shanty boy and his untimely fate;<br>
Concerning a young river man, so manly, true and brave;<br>
'Twas on a jam at Gerry's Rock he met his watery grave;</p>

<p>'Twas on a Sunday morning as you will quickly hear,<br>
Our logs were piled up mountain high, we could not keep them clear.<br>
Our foreman said, "Come on, brave boys, with hearts devoid of fear,<br>
We'll break the jam on Gerry's Rock and for Agonstown we'll steer."</p>

<p>Now, some of them were willing, while others they were not,<br>
All for to work on Sunday they did not think they ought;<br>
But six of our brave shanty boys had volunteered to go<br>
And break the jam on Gerry's Rock with their foreman, young Monroe.</p>

<p>They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span> had not rolled off many logs 'till they heard his clear voice say,<br>
"I'd have you boys be on your guard, for the jam will soon give way."<br>
These words he'd scarcely spoken when the jam did break and go,<br>
Taking with it six of those brave boys and their foreman, young Monroe.</p>

<p>Now when those other shanty boys this sad news came to hear,<br>
In search of their dead comrades to the river they did steer;<br>
Six of their mangled bodies a-floating down did go,<br>
While crushed and bleeding near the banks lay the foreman, young Monroe.</p>

<p>They took him from his watery grave, brushed back his raven hair;<br>
There was a fair form among them whose cries did rend the air;<br>
There was a fair form among them, a girl from Saginaw town.<br>
Whose cries rose to the skies for her lover who'd gone down.</p>

<p>Fair Clara was a noble girl, the river-man's true friend;<br>
She and her widowed mother lived at the river's bend;<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> the wages of her own true love the boss to her did pay,<br>
But the shanty boys for her made up a generous sum next day.</p>

<p>They buried him quite decently; 'twas on the first of May;<br>
Come all you brave young shanty boys and for your comrade pray.<br>
Engraved upon the hemlock tree that by the grave does grow<br>
Is the aged date and the sad fate of the foreman, young Monroe.</p>

<p>Fair Clara did not long survive, her heart broke with her grief;<br>
And less than three months afterwards Death came to her relief;<br>
And when the time had come and she was called to go,<br>
Her last request was granted, to be laid by young Monroe.</p>

<p>Come all you brave young shanty boys, I'd have you call and see<br>
Two green graves by the river side where grows a hemlock tree;<br>
The shanty boys cut off the wood where lay those lovers low,&mdash;<br>
'Tis the handsome Clara Vernon and her true love, Jack Monroe.</p>

<p>Kind friends, you must pity my horrible tale,<br>
I am an object of pity, I am looking quite stale,<br>
I gave up my trade selling Right's Patent Pills<br>
To go hunting gold in the dreary Black Hills.</p>

<p class="add1em">Don't go away, stay at home if you can,<br>
  Stay away from that city, they call it Cheyenne,<br>
  For big Walipe or Comanche Bills<br>
  They will lift up your hair on the dreary Black Hills.</p>

<p>The round-house in Cheyenne is filled every night<br>
With loafers and bummers of most every plight;<br>
On their backs is no clothes, in their pockets no bills,<br>
Each day they keep starting for the dreary Black Hills.</p>

<p>I got to Cheyenne, no gold could I find,<br>
I thought of the lunch route I'd left far behind;<br>
Through rain, hail, and snow, frozen plumb to the gills,&mdash;<br>
They call me the orphan of the dreary Black Hills.</p>

<p>Kind friend, to conclude, my advice I'll unfold,<br>
Don't go to the Black Hills a-hunting for gold;<br>

<p>I used to live on Cottonwood and owned a little farm,<br>
I was called upon a mission that gave me much alarm;<br>
The reason that they called me, I'm sure I do not know.<br>
But to hoe the cane and cotton, straightway I must go.</p>

<p>I yoked up Jim and Baldy, all ready for the start;<br>
To leave my farm and garden, it almost broke my heart;<br>
But at last we got started, I cast a look behind,<br>
For the sand and rocks of Dixie were running through my mind.</p>

<p>Now, when we got to Black Ridge, my wagon it broke down,<br>
And I, being no carpenter and forty miles from town,&mdash;<br>
I cut a clumsy cedar and rigged an awkward slide,<br>
But the wagon ran so heavy poor Betsy couldn't ride.</p>

<p>While Betsy was out walking I told her to take care,<br>
When all of a sudden she struck a prickly pear,<br>
Then she began to hollow as loud as she could bawl,&mdash;<br>
If I were back in Cottonwood, I wouldn't go at all.</p>

<p>Now, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span> when we got to Sand Ridge, we couldn't go at all,<br>
Old Jim and old Baldy began to puff and loll,<br>
I cussed and swore a little, for I couldn't make the route,<br>
For the team and I and Betsy were all of us played out.</p>

<p>At length we got to Washington; I thought we'd stay a while<br>
To see if the flowers would make their virgin smile,<br>
But I was much mistaken, for when we went away<br>
The red hills of September were just the same in May.</p>

<p>It is so very dreary, there's nothing here to cheer,<br>
But old pathetic sermons we very often hear;<br>
They preach them by the dozens and prove them by the book,<br>
But I'd sooner have a roasting-ear and stay at home and cook.</p>

<p>I am so awful weary I'm sure I'm almost dead;<br>
'Tis six long weeks last Sunday since I have tasted bread;<br>
Of turnip-tops and lucerne greens I've had enough to eat,<br>
But I'd like to change my diet to buckwheat cakes and meat.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> had to sell my wagon for sorghum seed and bread;<br>
Old Jim and old Baldy have long since been dead.<br>
There's no one left but me and Bet to hoe the cotton tree,&mdash;<br>
God pity any Mormon that attempts to follow me!</p>

<p>Come all you pretty girls, to you these lines I'll write,<br>
We are going to the range in which we take delight;<br>
We are going on the range as we poor hunters do,<br>
And the tender-footed fellows can stay at home with you.</p>

<p>It's all of the day long as we go tramping round<br>
In search of the buffalo that we may shoot him down;<br>
Our guns upon our shoulders, our belts of forty rounds,<br>
We send them up Salt River to some happy hunting grounds.</p>

<p>Our game, it is the antelope, the buffalo, wolf, and deer,<br>
Who roam the wide prairies without a single fear;<br>
We rob him of his robe and think it is no harm,<br>
To buy us food and clothing to keep our bodies warm.</p>

<p>The buffalo, he is the noblest of the band,<br>
He sometimes rejects in throwing up his hand.<br>
His shaggy main thrown forward, his head raised to the sky,<br>
He seems <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span> to say, "We're coming, boys; so hunter, mind your eye."</p>

<p>Our fires are made of mesquite roots, our beds are on the ground;<br>
Our houses made of buffalo hides, we make them tall and round;<br>
Our furniture is the camp kettle, the coffee pot, and pan,<br>
Our chuck it is both bread and meat, mingled well with sand.</p>

<p>Our neighbors are the Cheyennes, the 'Rapahoes, and Sioux,<br>
Their mode of navigation is a buffalo-hide canoe.<br>
And when they come upon you they take you unaware,<br>
And such a peculiar way they have of raising hunter's hair.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE LITTLE OLD SOD SHANTY <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span></p>

<p>I am looking rather seedy now while holding down my claim,<br>
And my victuals are not always served the best;<br>
And the mice play shyly round me as I nestle down to rest<br>
In my little old sod shanty on my claim.</p>

<p class="add1em">The hinges are of leather and the windows have no glass,<br>
  While the board roof lets the howling blizzards in,<br>
  And I hear the hungry cayote as he slinks up through the grass<br>
  Round the little old sod shanty on my claim.</p>

<p>Yet, I rather like the novelty of living in this way,<br>
Though my bill of fare is always rather tame,<br>
But I'm happy as a clam on the land of Uncle Sam<br>
In the little old sod shanty on my claim.</p>

<p>But when I left my Eastern home, a bachelor so gay,<br>
To try and win my way to wealth and fame,<br>
I little thought I'd come down to burning twisted hay<br>
In the little old sod shanty on my claim.</p>

<p>My <span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>(p. 188)</span> clothes are plastered o'er with dough, I'm looking like a fright,<br>
And everything is scattered round the room,<br>
But I wouldn't give the freedom that I have out in the West<br>
For the table of the Eastern man's old home.</p>

<p>Still, I wish that some kind-hearted girl would pity on me take<br>
And relieve me from the mess that I am in;<br>
The angel, how I'd bless her if this her home she'd make<br>
In the little old sod shanty on my claim.</p>

<p>And we would make our fortunes on the prairies of the West,<br>
Just as happy as two lovers we'd remain;<br>
We'd forget the trials and troubles we endured at the first<br>
In the little old sod shanty on my claim.</p>

<p>And if fate should bless us with now and then an heir<br>
To cheer our hearts with honest pride of fame,<br>
Oh, then we'd be contented for the toil that we had spent<br>
In the little old sod shanty on our claim.</p>

<p>When time enough had lapsed and all those little brats<br>
To <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span> noble man and womanhood had grown,<br>
It wouldn't seem half so lonely as round us we should look<br>
And we'd see the old sod shanty on our claim.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE GOL-DARNED WHEEL <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span></p>

<p>I can take the wildest bronco in the tough old woolly West.<br>
I can ride him, I can break him, let him do his level best;<br>
I can handle any cattle ever wore a coat of hair,<br>
And I've had a lively tussle with a tarnel grizzly bear.<br>
I can rope and throw the longhorn of the wildest Texas brand,<br>
And in Indian disagreements I can play a leading hand,<br>
But at last I got my master and he surely made me squeal<br>
When the boys got me a-straddle of that gol-darned wheel.</p>

<p>It was at the Eagle Ranch, on the Brazos,<br>
When I first found that darned contrivance that upset me in the dust.<br>
A tenderfoot had brought it, he was wheeling all the way<br>
From the sun-rise end of freedom out to San Francisco Bay.<br>
He tied up at the ranch for to get outside a meal,<br>
Never thinking we would monkey with his gol-darned wheel.</p>

<p>Arizona <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> Jim begun it when he said to Jack McGill<br>
There was fellows forced to limit bragging on their riding skill,<br>
And he'd venture the admission the same fellow that he meant<br>
Was a very handy cutter far as riding bronchos went;<br>
But he would find that he was bucking 'gainst a different kind of deal<br>
If he threw his leather leggins 'gainst a gol-darned wheel.</p>

<p>Such a slam against my talent made me hotter than a mink,<br>
And I swore that I would ride him for amusement or for chink.<br>
And it was nothing but a plaything for the kids and such about,<br>
And they'd have their ideas shattered if they'd lead the critter out.<br>
They held it while I mounted and gave the word to go;<br>
The shove they gave to start me warn't unreasonably slow.<br>
But I never spilled a cuss word and I never spilled a squeal&mdash;<br>
I was building reputation on that gol-darned wheel.</p>

<p>Holy Moses and the Prophets, how we split the Texas air,<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> the wind it made whip-crackers of my same old canthy hair,<br>
And I sorta comprehended as down the hill we went<br>
There was bound to be a smash-up that I couldn't well prevent.<br>
Oh, how them punchers bawled, "Stay with her, Uncle Bill!<br>
Stick your spurs in her, you sucker! turn her muzzle up the hill!"<br>
But I never made an answer, I just let the cusses squeal,<br>
I was finding reputation on that gol-darned wheel.</p>

<p>The grade was mighty sloping from the ranch down to the creek<br>
And I went a-galliflutin' like a crazy lightning streak,&mdash;<br>
Went whizzing and a-darting first this way and then that,<br>
The darned contrivance sort o' wobbling like the flying of a bat.<br>
I pulled upon the handles, but I couldn't check it up,<br>
And I yanked and sawed and hollowed but the darned thing wouldn't stop.<br>
Then a sort of a meachin' in my brain began to steal,<br>
That the devil held a mortgage on that gol-darned wheel.</p>

<p>I've <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span> a sort of dim and hazy remembrance of the stop,<br>
With the world a-goin' round and the stars all tangled up;<br>
Then there came an intermission that lasted till I found<br>
I was lying at the ranch with the boys all gathered round,<br>
And a doctor was a-sewing on the skin where it was ripped,<br>
And old Arizona whispered, "Well, old boy, I guess you're whipped,"<br>
And I told him I was busted from sombrero down to heel,<br>
And he grinned and said, "You ought to see that gol-darned wheel."</p>

This last of a noble race.</p>

<p>The ancient eunuch struggled<br>
And raised his shaking head,<br>
Saying, "I care not to linger<br>
When all my friends are dead.<br>
These Jerseys and these Holsteins,<br>
They are no friends of mine;<br>
They belong to the nobility<br>
Who live across the brine.</p>

<p>"Tell the Durhams and the Herefords<br>
When they come a-grazing round,<br>
And see me lying stark and stiff<br>
Upon the frozen ground,<br>
I don't want them to bellow<br>
When they see that I am dead,<br>
For I was born in Texas<br>
Near the river that is Red.</p>

<p>"Tell <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span> the cayotes, when they come at night<br>
A-hunting for their prey,<br>
They might as well go further,<br>
For they'll find it will not pay.<br>
If they attempt to eat me,<br>
They very soon will see<br>
That my bones and hide are petrified,&mdash;<br>
They'll find no beef on me.</p>

<p>"I remember back in the seventies,<br>
Full many summers past,<br>
There was grass and water plenty,<br>
But it was too good to last.<br>
I little dreamed what would happen<br>
Some twenty summers hence,<br>
When the nester came with his wife, his kids,<br>
His dogs, and his barbed-wire fence."</p>

<p>His voice sank to a murmur,<br>
His breath was short and quick;<br>
The cowboy tried to skin him<br>
When he saw he couldn't kick;<br>
He rubbed his knife upon his boot<br>
Until he made it shine,<br>
But he never skinned old longhorn,<br>
Caze he couldn't cut his rine.</p>

<p>And the cowboy riz up sadly<br>
And mounted his cayuse,<br>
Saying, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span> "The time has come when longhorns<br>
And their cowboys are no use!"<br>
And while gazing sadly backward<br>
Upon the dead bovine,<br>
His bronc stepped in a dog-hole<br>
And fell and broke his spine.</p>

<p>The cowboys and the longhorns<br>
Who partnered in eighty-four<br>
Have gone to their last round-up<br>
Over on the other shore;<br>
They answered well their purpose,<br>
But their glory must fade and go,<br>
Because men say there's better things<br>
In the modern cattle show.</p>

<p>Fare you well, green fields,<br>
Soft meadows, adieu!<br>
Rocks and mountains,<br>
I depart from you;<br>
Nevermore shall my eyes<br>
By your beauties be blest,<br>
Nevermore shall you soothe<br>
My sad bosom to rest.</p>

<p>Farewell, little birdies,<br>
That fly in the sky,<br>
You fly all day long<br>
And sing your troubles by;<br>
I am doomed to this cell,<br>
I heave a deep sigh;<br>
My heart sinks within me,<br>
In anguish I die.</p>

<p>Fare you well, little fishes,<br>
That glides through the sea,<br>
Your life's all sunshine,<br>
All light, and all glee;<br>
Nevermore shall I watch<br>
Your skill in the wave,<br>
I'll depart from all friends<br>
This side of the grave.</p>

<p>What <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> would I give<br>
Such freedom to share,<br>
To roam at my ease<br>
And breathe the fresh air;<br>
I would roam through the cities,<br>
Through village and dell,<br>
But I never would return<br>
To my cold prison cell.</p>

<p>What's life without liberty?<br>
I ofttimes have said,<br>
Of a poor troubled mind<br>
That's always in dread;<br>
No sun, moon, and stars<br>
Can on me now shine,<br>
No change in my danger<br>
From daylight till dawn.</p>

<p>Fare you well, kind friends,<br>
I am willing to own,<br>
Such a wild outcast<br>
Never was known;<br>
I'm the downfall of my family,<br>
My children, my wife;<br>
God pity and pardon<br>
The poor prisoner for life.</p>

<p>There was a wealthy merchant,<br>
In London he did dwell,<br>
He had an only daughter,<br>
The truth to you I'll tell.<br>
    <span class="add2em">Sing I am left alone,</span><br>
    <span class="add2em">Sing I am left alone.</span></p>

<p>She was courted by a lord<br>
Of very high degree,<br>
She was courted by a sailor Jack<br>
Just from the wars of Germany.<br>
     <span class="add2em">Sing I am left alone,</span><br>

     <span class="add2em">Sing I am left alone,</span><br>

<p>She <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> went to the tailor's shop<br>

<p class="tit-song">FREIGHTING FROM WILCOX TO GLOBE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span></p>

<p>Come all you jolly freighters<br>
That has freighted on the road,<br>
That has hauled a load of freight<br>
From Wilcox to Globe;<br>
We freighted on this road<br>
For sixteen years or more<br>
A-hauling freight for Livermore,&mdash;<br>
No wonder that I'm poor.</p>

<p class="add2em">And it's home, dearest home;<br>
    And it's home you ought to be,<br>
    Over on the Gila<br>
    In the white man's country,<br>
    Where the poplar and the ash<br>
    And mesquite will ever be<br>
    Growing green down on the Gila;<br>
    There's a home for you and me.</p>

<p>'Twas in the spring of seventy-three<br>
I started with my team,<br>
Led by false illusion<br>
And those foolish, golden dreams;<br>
The first night out from Wilcox<br>
My best wheel horse was stole,<br>
And it makes me curse a little<br>
To come out in the hole.</p>

<p>This <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span> then only left me three,&mdash;<br>
Kit, Mollie and old Mike;<br>
Mike being the best one of the three<br>
I put him out on spike;<br>
I then took the mountain road<br>
So the people would not smile,<br>
And it took fourteen days<br>
To travel thirteen mile.</p>

<p>But I got there all the same<br>
With my little three-up spike;<br>
It taken all my money, then,<br>
To buy a mate for Mike.<br>
You all know how it is<br>
When once you get behind,<br>
You never get even again<br>
Till you damn steal them blind.</p>

<p>I was an honest man<br>
When I first took to the road,<br>
I would not swear an oath,<br>
Nor would I tap a load;<br>
But now you ought to see my mules<br>
When I begin to cuss,<br>
They flop their ears and wiggle their tails<br>
And pull the load or bust.</p>

<p>Now I can tap a whiskey barrel<br>
With nothing but a stick,<br>
No one can detect me<br>
I've got it down so slick;<br>
Just <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span> fill it up with water,&mdash;<br>
Sure, there's no harm in that.</p>

<p>Now my clothes are not the finest,<br>
Nor are they genteel;<br>
But they will have to do me<br>
Till I can make another steal.<br>
My boots are number elevens,<br>
For I swiped them from a chow,<br>
And my coat cost dos reals<br>
From a little Apache squaw.</p>

<p>Now I have freighted in the sand,<br>
I have freighted in the rain,<br>
I have bogged my wagons down<br>
And dug them out again;<br>
I have worked both late and early<br>
Till I was almost dead,<br>
And I have spent some nights sleeping<br>
In an Arizona bed.</p>

<p>Now barbed wire and bacon<br>
Is all that they will pay,<br>
But you have to show your copper checks<br>
To get your grain and hay;<br>
If you ask them for five dollars,<br>
Old Meyers will scratch his pate,<br>
And the clerks in their white, stiff collars<br>
Say, "Get down and pull your freight."</p>

<p>But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> I want to die and go to hell,<br>
Get there before Livermore and Meyers,<br>
And get a job of hauling coke<br>
To keep up the devil's fires;<br>
If I get the job of singeing them,<br>
I'll see they don't get free;<br>
I'll treat them like a yaller dog,<br>
As they have treated me.</p>

<p class="add2em">And it's home, dearest home;<br>
    And it's home you ought to be,<br>
    Over on the Gila,<br>
    In the white man's country,<br>
    Where the poplar and the ash<br>
    And mesquite will ever be<br>

<p class="tit-song">THE ARIZONA BOYS AND GIRLS <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span></p>

<p>Come all of you people, I pray you draw near,<br>
A comical ditty you all shall hear.<br>
The boys in this country they try to advance<br>
By courting the ladies and learning to dance,&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>The boys in this country they try to be plain,<br>
Those words that you hear you may hear them again,<br>
With twice as much added on if you can.<br>
There's many a boy stuck up for a man,&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>They will go to their parties, their whiskey they'll take,<br>
And out in the dark their bottles they'll break;<br>
You'll hear one say, "There's a bottle around here;<br>
So come around, boys, and we'll all take a share,"&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>There is some wears shoes and some wears boots,<br>
But there are very few that rides who don't shoot;<br>
More than this, I'll tell you what they'll do,<br>
They'll get them a watch and a ranger hat, too,&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>They'll go in the hall with spurs on their heel,<br>
They'll get them a partner to dance the next reel,<br>
Saying, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> "How do I look in my new brown suit,<br>
With my pants stuffed down in the top of my boot?"&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>Now I think it's quite time to leave off these lads<br>
For here are some girls that's fully as bad;<br>
They'll trim up their dresses and curl up their hair,<br>
And like an old owl before the glass they'll stare,&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>The girls in the country they grin like a cat,<br>
And with giggling and laughing they don't know what they're at,<br>
They think they're pretty and I tell you they're wise,<br>
But they couldn't get married to save their two eyes,&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>You can tell a good girl wherever she's found;<br>
No trimming, no lace, no nonsense around;<br>
With a long-eared bonnet tied under her chin,&mdash;</p>

<hr class="small">

<p>And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>They'll go to church with their snuff-box in hand,<br>
They'll give it a tap to make it look grand;<br>
Perhaps there is another one or two<br>
And they'll pass it around and it's "Madam, won't you,"&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>

<p>Now, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> I think it's quite time for this ditty to end;<br>
If there's anyone here that it will offend,<br>
If there's anyone here that thinks it amiss<br>
Just come around now and give the singer a kiss,&mdash;<br>
And they're down, down, and they're down.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE DYING RANGER <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span></p>

<p>The sun was sinking in the west<br>
And fell with lingering ray<br>
Through the branches of a forest<br>
Where a wounded ranger lay;<br>
Beneath the shade of a palmetto<br>
And the sunset silvery sky,<br>
Far away from his home in Texas<br>
They laid him down to die.</p>

<p>A group had gathered round him,<br>
His comrades in the fight,<br>
A tear rolled down each manly cheek<br>
As he bid a last good-night.<br>
One tried and true companion<br>
Was kneeling by his side,<br>
To stop his life-blood flowing,<br>
But alas, in vain he tried.</p>

<p>When to stop the life-blood flowing<br>
He found 'twas all in vain,<br>
The tears rolled down each man's cheek<br>
Like light showers of rain.<br>
Up spoke the noble ranger,<br>
"Boys, weep no more for me,<br>
I am crossing the deep waters<br>
To a country that is free.</p>

<p>"Draw <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> closer to me, comrades,<br>
And listen to what I say,<br>
I am going to tell a story<br>
While my spirit hastens away.<br>
Way back in Northwest Texas,<br>
That good old Lone Star state,<br>
There is one that for my coming<br>
With a weary heart will wait.</p>

<p>"A fair young girl, my sister,<br>
My only joy, my pride,<br>
She was my friend from boyhood,<br>
I had no one left beside.<br>
I have loved her as a brother,<br>
And with a father's care<br>
I have strove from grief and sorrov<br>
Her gentle heart to spare.</p>

<p>"My mother, she lies sleeping<br>
Beneath the church-yard sod,<br>
And many a day has passed away<br>
Since her spirit fled to God.<br>
My father, he lies sleeping<br>
Beneath the deep blue sea,<br>
I have no other kindred,<br>
There are none but Nell and me.</p>

<p>"But our country was invaded<br>
And they called for volunteers;<br>
She threw her arms around me,<br>
Then burst into tears,<br>
Saying, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span> 'Go, my darling brother,<br>
Drive those traitors from our shore,<br>
My heart may need your presence,<br>
But our country needs you more.'</p>

<p>"It is true I love my country,<br>
For her I gave my all.<br>
If it hadn't been for my sister,<br>
I would be content to fall.<br>
I am dying, comrades, dying,<br>
She will never see me more,<br>
But in vain she'll wait my coming<br>
By our little cabin door.</p>

<p>"Comrades, gather closer<br>
And listen to my dying prayer.<br>
Who will be to her as a brother,<br>
And shield her with a brother's care?"<br>
Up spake the noble rangers,<br>
They answered one and all,<br>
"We will be to her as brothers<br>
Till the last one does fall."</p>

<p>One glad smile of pleasure<br>
O'er the ranger's face was spread;<br>
One dark, convulsive shadow,<br>
And the ranger boy was dead.<br>
Far from his darling sister<br>
We laid him down to rest<br>
With his saddle for a pillow<br>
And his gun across his breast.</p>

<p class="tit-song">THE FAIR FANNIE MOORE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span></p>

<p>Yonder stands a cottage,<br>
All deserted and alone,<br>
Its paths are neglected,<br>
With grass overgrown;<br>
Go in and you will see<br>
Some dark stains on the floor,&mdash;<br>
Alas! it is the blood<br>
Of fair Fannie Moore.</p>

<p>To Fannie, so blooming,<br>
Two lovers they came;<br>
One offered young Fannie<br>
His wealth and his name;<br>
But neither his money<br>
Nor pride could secure<br>
A place in the heart<br>
Of fair Fannie Moore.</p>

<p>The first was young Randell,<br>
So bold and so proud,<br>
Who to the fair Fannie<br>
His haughty head bowed;<br>
But his wealth and his house<br>
Both failed to allure<br>
The heart from the bosom<br>
Of fair Fannie Moore.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> next was young Henry,<br>
Of lowest degree.<br>
He won her fond love<br>
And enraptured was he;<br>
And then at the altar<br>
He quick did secure<br>
The hand with the heart<br>
Of the fair Fannie Moore.</p>

<p>As she was alone<br>
In her cottage one day,<br>
When business had called<br>
Her fond husband away,<br>
Young Randell, the haughty,<br>
Came in at the door<br>
And clasped in his arms<br>
The fair Fannie Moore.</p>

<p>"O Fannie, O Fannie,<br>
Reflect on your fate<br>
And accept of my offer<br>
Before it's too late;<br>
For one thing to-night<br>
I am bound to secure,&mdash;<br>
'Tis the love or the life<br>
Of the fair Fannie Moore."</p>

<p>"Spare me, Oh, spare me!"<br>
The young Fannie cries,<br>
While the tears swiftly flow<br>
From <span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span> her beautiful eyes;<br>
"Oh, no!" cries young Randell,<br>
"Go home to your rest,"<br>
And he buried his knife<br>
In her snowy white breast.</p>

<p>So Fannie, so blooming,<br>
In her bright beauty died;<br>
Young Randell, the haughty,<br>
Was taken and tried;<br>
At length he was hung<br>
On a tree at the door,<br>
For shedding the blood<br>
Of the fair Fannie Moore.</p>

<p>Young Henry, the shepherd,<br>
Distracted and wild,<br>
Did wander away<br>
From his own native isle.<br>
Till at length, claimed by death,<br>
He was brought to this shore<br>
And laid by the side<br>
Of the fair Fannie Moore.</p>


<p class="tit-song">HELL IN TEXAS <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span></p>

<p>The devil, we're told, in hell was chained,<br>
And a thousand years he there remained;<br>
He never complained nor did he groan,<br>
But determined to start a hell of his own,<br>
Where he could torment the souls of men<br>
Without being chained in a prison pen.<br>
So he asked the Lord if he had on hand<br>
Anything left when he made the land.</p>

<p>The Lord said, "Yes, I had plenty on hand,<br>
But I left it down on the Rio Grande;<br>
The fact is, old boy, the stuff is so poor<br>
I don't think you could use it in hell anymore."<br>
But the devil went down to look at the truck,<br>
And said if it came as a gift he was stuck;<br>
For after examining it carefully and well<br>
He concluded the place was too dry for hell.</p>

<p>So, in order to get it off his hands,<br>
The Lord promised the devil to water the lands;<br>
For he had some water, or rather some dregs,<br>
A regular cathartic that smelled like bad eggs.<br>
Hence the deal was closed and the deed was given<br>
And the Lord went back to his home in heaven.<br>
And the devil then said, "I have all that is needed<br>
To make a good hell," and hence he succeeded.</p>

<p>He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> began to put thorns in all of the trees,<br>
And mixed up the sand with millions of fleas;<br>
And scattered tarantulas along all the roads;<br>
Put thorns on the cactus and horns on the toads.<br>
He lengthened the horns of the Texas steers,<br>
And put an addition on the rabbit's ears;<br>
He put a little devil in the broncho steed,<br>
And poisoned the feet of the centipede.</p>

<p>The rattlesnake bites you, the scorpion stings,<br>
The mosquito delights you with buzzing wings;<br>
The sand-burrs prevail and so do the ants,<br>
And those who sit down need half-soles on their pants.<br>
The devil then said that throughout the land<br>
He'd managed to keep up the devil's own brand,<br>
And all would be mavericks unless they bore<br>
The marks of scratches and bites and thorns by the score.</p>

<p>The heat in the summer is a hundred and ten,<br>
Too hot for the devil and too hot for men.<br>
The wild boar roams through the black chaparral,&mdash;<br>
It's a hell of a place he has for a hell.<br>
The red pepper grows on the banks of the brook;<br>
The Mexicans use it in all that they cook.<br>
Just dine with a Greaser and then you will shout,<br>
"I've hell on the inside as well as the out!"</p>

<p>By Markentura's flowery marge the Red Chief's wigwam stood,<br>
Before the white man's rifle rang, loud echoing through the wood;<br>
The tommy-hawk and scalping knife together lay at rest,<br>
And peace was in the forest shade and in the red man's breast.</p>

<p class="add1em">Oh, the Spotted Fawn, oh, the Spotted Fawn,<br>
  The life and light of the forest shade,&mdash;<br>
  The Red Chief's child is gone!</p>

<p>By Markentura's flowery marge the Spotted Fawn had birth<br>
And grew as fair an Indian maid as ever graced the earth.<br>
She was the Red Chief's only child and sought by many a brave,<br>
But to the gallant young White Cloud her plighted troth she gave.</p>

<p>By Markentura's flowery marge the bridal song arose,<br>
Nor dreamed they in that festive night of near approaching woes;<br>
But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> through the forest stealthily the white man came in wrath.<br>
And fiery darts before them spread, and death was in their path.</p>

<p>By Markentura's flowery marge next morn no strife was seen,<br>
But a wail went up, for the young Fawn's blood and White Cloud's dyed the green.<br>
A burial in their own rude way the Indians gave them there,<br>
And a low sweet requiem the brook sang and the air.</p>

<p class="add1em">Oh, the Spotted Fawn, oh, the Spotted Fawn,<br>

<p>My name is Stamford Barnes, I come from Nobleville town;<br>
I've traveled this wide world over, I've traveled this wide world round.<br>
I've met with ups and downs in life but better days I've saw,<br>
But I've never knew what misery were till I came to Arkansaw.</p>

<p>I landed in St. Louis with ten dollars and no more;<br>
I read the daily papers till both my eyes were sore;<br>
I read them evening papers until at last I saw<br>
Ten thousand men were wanted in the state of Arkansaw.</p>

<p>I wiped my eyes with great surprise when I read this grateful news,<br>
And straightway off I started to see the agent, Billy Hughes.<br>
He says, "Pay me five dollars and a ticket to you I'll draw,<br>
It'll land you safe upon the railroad in the State of Arkansaw."</p>

<p>I started off one morning a quarter after five;<br>
I started from St. Louis, half dead and half alive;<br>
I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> bought me a quart of whiskey my misery to thaw,<br>
I got as drunk as a biled owl when I left for old Arkansaw.</p>

<p>I landed in Ft. Smith one sultry Sunday afternoon,<br>
It was in the month of May, the early month of June,<br>
Up stepped a walking skeleton with a long and lantern jaw,<br>
Invited me to his hotel, "The best in Arkansaw."</p>

<p>I followed my conductor into his dwelling place;<br>
Poverty were depictured in his melancholy face.<br>
His bread it was corn dodger, his beef I could not chaw;<br>
This was the kind of hash they fed me in the State of Arkansaw.</p>

<p>I started off next morning to catch the morning train,<br>
He says to me, "You'd better work, for I have some land to drain.<br>
I'll pay you fifty cents a day, your board, washing, and all,&mdash;<br>
You'll find yourself a different man when you leave old Arkansaw."</p>

<p>I worked six weeks for the son of a gun, Jesse Herring was his name,<br>
He was six foot seven in his stocking feet and taller than any crane;<br>
His <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> hair hung down in strings over his long and lantern jaw,&mdash;<br>
He was a photograph of all the gents who lived in Arkansaw.</p>

<p>He fed me on corn dodgers as hard as any rock,<br>
Until my teeth began to loosen and my knees began to knock;<br>
I got so thin on sassafras tea I could hide behind a straw,<br>
And indeed I was a different man when I left old Arkansaw.</p>

<p>Farewell to swamp angels, cane brakes, and chills;<br>
Farewell to sage and sassafras and corn dodger pills.<br>
If ever I see this land again, I'll give to you my paw;<br>
It will be through a telescope from here to Arkansaw.</p>

<p>Oh, I am a Texas cowboy,<br>
Far away from home,<br>
If ever I get back to Texas<br>
I never more will roam.</p>

<p>Montana is too cold for me<br>
And the winters are too long;<br>
Before the round-ups do begin<br>
Our money is all gone.</p>

<p>Take this old hen-skin bedding,<br>
Too thin to keep me warm,&mdash;<br>
I nearly freeze to death, my boys.<br>
Whenever there's a storm.</p>

<p>And take this old "tarpoleon,"<br>
Too thin to shield my frame,&mdash;<br>
I got it down in Nebraska<br>
A-dealin' a Monte game.</p>

<p>Now to win these fancy leggins<br>
I'll have enough to do;<br>
They cost me twenty dollars<br>
The day that they were new.</p>

<p>I have an outfit on the Mussel Shell,<br>
But that I'll never see,<br>
Unless <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> I get sent to represent<br>
The Circle or D.T.</p>

<p>I've worked down in Nebraska<br>
Where the grass grows ten feet high,<br>
And the cattle are such rustlers<br>
That they seldom ever die;</p>

<p>I've worked up in the sand hills<br>
And down upon the Platte,<br>
Where the cowboys are good fellows<br>
And the cattle always fat;</p>

<p>I've traveled lots of country,&mdash;<br>
Nebraska's hills of sand,<br>
Down through the Indian Nation,<br>
And up the Rio Grande;&mdash;</p>

<p>But the Bad Lands of Montana<br>
Are the worst I ever seen,<br>
The cowboys are all tenderfeet<br>
And the dogies are too lean.</p>

<p>If you want to see some bad lands,<br>
Go over on the Dry;<br>
You will bog down in the coulees<br>
Where the mountains reach the sky.</p>

<p>A tenderfoot to lead you<br>
Who never knows the way,<br>
You <span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> are playing in the best of luck<br>
If you eat more than once a day.</p>

<p>Your grub is bread and bacon<br>
And coffee black as ink;<br>
The water is so full of alkali<br>
It is hardly fit to drink.</p>

<p>They will wake you in the morning<br>
Before the break of day,<br>
And send you on a circle<br>
A hundred miles away.</p>

<p>All along the Yellowstone<br>
'Tis cold the year around;<br>
You will surely get consumption<br>
By sleeping on the ground.</p>

<p>Work in Montana<br>
Is six months in the year;<br>
When all your bills are settled<br>
There is nothing left for beer.</p>

<p>Work down in Texas<br>
Is all the year around;<br>
You will never get consumption<br>
By sleeping on the ground.</p>

<p>Come all you Texas cowboys<br>
And warning take from me,<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span> do not go to Montana<br>

<p>A cowboy's life is a dreary, dreary life,<br>
Some say it's free from care;<br>
Rounding up the cattle from morning till night<br>
In the middle of the prairie so bare.</p>

<p class="add1em">Half-past four, the noisy cook will roar,<br>
 "Whoop-a-whoop-a-hey!"<br>
  Slowly you will rise with sleepy-feeling eyes,<br>
  The sweet, dreamy night passed away.</p>

<p>The greener lad he thinks it's play,<br>
He'll soon peter out on a cold rainy day,<br>
With his big bell spurs and his Spanish hoss,<br>
He'll swear to you he was once a boss.</p>

<p>The cowboy's life is a dreary, dreary life,<br>
He's driven through the heat and cold;<br>
While the rich man's a-sleeping on his velvet couch,<br>
Dreaming of his silver and gold.</p>

<p>Spring-time sets in, double trouble will begin,<br>
The weather is so fierce and cold;<br>
Clothes are wet and frozen to our necks,<br>
The cattle we can scarcely hold.</p>

<p>The cowboy's life is a dreary one,<br>
He works all day to the setting of the sun;<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> then his day's work is not done,<br>
For there's his night herd to go on.</p>

<p>The wolves and owls with their terrifying howls<br>
Will disturb us in our midnight dream,<br>
As we lie on our slickers on a cold, rainy night<br>
Way over on the Pecos stream.</p>

<p>You are speaking of your farms, you are speaking of your charms,<br>
You are speaking of your silver and gold;<br>
But a cowboy's life is a dreary, dreary life,<br>
He's driven through the heat and cold.</p>

<p>Some folks say that we are free from care,<br>
Free from all other harm;<br>
But we round up the cattle from morning till night<br>
Way over on the prairie so dry.</p>

<p>I used to run about, now I stay at home,<br>
Take care of my wife and child;<br>
Nevermore to roam, always stay at home,<br>
Take care of my wife and child.</p>

<p class="add1em">Half-past four the noisy cook will roar,<br>
 "Hurrah, boys! she's breaking day!"<br>
  Slowly we will rise and wipe our sleepy eyes,<br>
  The sweet, dreamy night passed away.</p>

<p>It's Jim Farrow and John Farrow and little Simon, too,<br>
Have plenty of cattle where I have but few.<br>
Marking and branding both night and day,&mdash;<br>
It's "Keep still, boys, my boys, and you'll all get your pay."<br>
It's up to the courthouse, the first thing they know,<br>
Before the Grand Jury they'll have to go.<br>
They'll ask you about ear-marks, they'll ask you about brand,<br>
But tell them you were absent when the work was on hand.<br>
Jim Farrow brands J.F. on the side;<br>
The next comes Johnnie who takes the whole hide;<br>
Little Simon, too has H. on the loin;&mdash;<br>
All stand for Farrow but it's not good for Sime.<br>
You ask for the mark, I don't think it's fair,<br>
You'll find the cow's head but the ear isn't there<br>
It's a crop and a split and a sort of a twine,&mdash;<br>
All stand for F. but it's not good for Sime.</p>

<p>"Get up, my boys," Jim Farrow will say,<br>
"And out to horse hunting before it is day."<br>
So we get up and are out on the way<br>
But it's damn few horses we find before day.<br>
"Now saddle your horses and out on the peaks<br>
To <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> see if the heifers are out on the creeks."<br>

<p class="tit-song">YOUNG CHARLOTTIE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span></p>

<p>Young Charlottie lived by a mountain side in a wild and lonely spot,<br>
There was no village for miles around except her father's cot;<br>
And yet on many a wintry night young boys would gather there,&mdash;<br>
Her father kept a social board, and she was very fair.</p>

<p>One New Year's Eve as the sun went down, she cast a wistful eye<br>
Out from the window pane as a merry sleigh went by.<br>
At a village fifteen miles away was to be a ball that night;<br>
Although the air was piercing cold, her heart was merry and light.</p>

<p>At last her laughing eye lit up as a well-known voice she heard,<br>
And dashing in front of the door her lover's sleigh appeared.<br>
"O daughter, dear," her mother said, "this blanket round you fold,<br>
'Tis such a dreadful night abroad and you will catch your death of cold."</p>

<p>"Oh <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> no, oh no!" young Charlottie cried, as she laughed like a gipsy queen,<br>
"To ride in blankets muffled up, I never would be seen.<br>
My silken coat is quite enough, you know it is lined throughout,<br>
And there is my silken scarf to wrap my head and neck about."</p>

<p>Her bonnet and her gloves were on, she jumped into the sleigh,<br>
And swiftly slid down the mountain side and over the hills away.<br>
All muffled up so silent, five miles at last were past<br>
When Charlie with few but shivering words, the silence broke at last.</p>

<p>"Such a dreadful night I never saw, my reins I can scarcely hold."<br>
Young Charlottie then feebly said, "I am exceedingly cold."<br>
He cracked his whip and urged his speed much faster than before,<br>
While at least five other miles in silence had passed o'er.</p>

<p>Spoke Charles, "How fast the freezing ice is gathering on my brow!"<br>
Young Charlottie then feebly said, "I'm growing warmer now."<br>
So <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span> on they sped through the frosty air and the glittering cold starlight<br>
Until at last the village lights and the ball-room came in sight.</p>

<p>They reached the door and Charles sprang out and reached his hands to her.<br>
"Why sit you there like a monument that has no power to stir?"<br>
He called her once, he called her twice, she answered not a word,<br>
And then he called her once again but still she never stirred.</p>

<p>He took her hand in his; 'twas cold and hard as any stone.<br>
He tore the mantle from her face while cold stars on it shone.<br>
Then quickly to the lighted hall her lifeless form he bore;&mdash;<br>
Young Charlottie's eyes were closed forever, her voice was heard no more.</p>

<p>And there he sat down by her side while bitter tears did flow,<br>
And cried, "My own, my charming bride, you nevermore shall know."<br>
He twined his arms around her neck and kissed her marble brow,<br>
And his thoughts flew back to where she said, "I'm growing warmer now."</p>

<p>He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> took her back into the sleigh and quickly hurried home;<br>
When he arrived at her father's door, oh, how her friends did mourn;<br>
They mourned the loss of a daughter dear, while Charles wept over the gloom,<br>
Till at last he died with the bitter grief,&mdash;now they both lie in one tomb.</p>

Whoa! skew, till I saddle you, whoa!</p>

<p>I crossed the river to the ranch where I intended to work,<br>
With a big six-shooter and a derned good dirk,&mdash;<br>
Whoa! skew, till I saddle you, whoa!</p>

<p>They roped me out a skew-ball black<br>
With a double set-fast on his back,&mdash;<br>
Whoa! skew, till I saddle you, whoa!</p>

<p>And when I was mounted on his back,<br>
The boys all yelled, "Just give him slack,"&mdash;<br>
Whoa! skew, till I saddle you, whoa!</p>

<p>They rolled and tumbled and yelled, by God,<br>
For he threw me a-whirling all over the sod,&mdash;<br>
Whoa! skew, till I saddle you, whoa!</p>

<p>I went to the boss and I told him I'd resign,<br>
The fool tumbled over, and I thought he was dyin',&mdash;<br>
Whoa! skew, till I saddle you, whoa!</p>

<p>And it's to Arkansaw I'll go back,<br>
To hell with Texas and the skew-ball black,&mdash;<br>

<p class="tit-song">THE RAMBLING COWBOY <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span></p>

<p>There was a rich old rancher who lived in the country by,<br>
He had a lovely daughter on whom I cast my eye;<br>
She was pretty, tall, and handsome, both neat and very fair,<br>
There's no other girl in the country with her I could compare.</p>

<p>I asked her if she would be willing for me to cross the plains;<br>
She said she would be truthful until I returned again;<br>
She said she would be faithful until death did prove unkind,<br>
So we kissed, shook hands, and parted, and I left my girl behind.</p>

<p>I left the State of Texas, for Arizona I was bound;<br>
I landed in Tombstone City, I viewed the place all round.<br>
Money and work were plentiful and the cowboys they were kind<br>
But the only thought of my heart was the girl I left behind.</p>

<p>One day as I was riding across the public square<br>
The mail-coach came in and I met the driver there;<br>
He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> handed me a letter which gave me to understand<br>
That the girl I left in Texas had married another man.</p>

<p>I turned myself all round and about not knowing what to do,<br>
But I read on down some further and it proved the words were true.<br>
Hard work I have laid over, it's gambling I have designed.<br>
I'll ramble this wide world over for the girl I left behind.</p>

<p>Come all you reckless and rambling boys who have listened to this song,<br>
If it hasn't done you any good, it hasn't done you any wrong;<br>
But when you court a pretty girl, just marry her while you can,<br>
For if you go across the plains she'll marry another man.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE COWBOY AT CHURCH <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span></p>

<p>Some time ago,&mdash;two weeks or more<br>
If I remember well,&mdash;<br>
I found myself in town and thought<br>
I'd knock around a spell,<br>
When all at once I heard the bell,&mdash;<br>
I didn't know 'twas Sunday,&mdash;<br>
For on the plains we scarcely know<br>
A Sunday from a Monday,&mdash;</p>

<p>A-calling all the people<br>
From the highways and the hedges<br>
And all the reckless throng<br>
That tread ruin's ragged edges,<br>
To come and hear the pastor tell<br>
Salvation's touching story,<br>
And how the new road misses hell<br>
And leads you straight to glory.</p>

<p>I started by the chapel door,<br>
But something urged me in,<br>
And told me not to spend God's day<br>
In revelry and sin.<br>
I don't go much on sentiment,<br>
But tears came in my eyes.<br>
It seemed just like my mother's voice<br>
Was speaking from the skies.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span> thought how often she had gone<br>
With little Sis and me<br>
To church, when I was but a lad<br>
Way back in Tennessee.<br>
It never once occurred to me<br>
About not being dressed<br>
In Sunday rig, but carelessly<br>
I went in with the rest.</p>

<p>You should have seen the smiles and shrugs<br>
As I went walking in,<br>
As though they thought my leggins<br>
Worse than any kind of sin;<br>
Although the honest parson,<br>
In his vestry garb arrayed<br>
Was dressed the same as I was,&mdash;<br>
In the trappings of his trade.</p>

<p>The good man prayed for all the world<br>
And all its motley crew,<br>
For pagan, Hindoo, sinners, Turk,<br>
And unbelieving Jew,&mdash;<br>
Though the congregation doubtless thought<br>
That the cowboys as a race<br>
Were a kind of moral outlaw<br>
With no good claim to grace.</p>

<p>Is it very strange that cowboys are<br>
A rough and reckless crew<br>
When their garb forbids their doing right<br>
As Christian people do?<br>
That <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> they frequent scenes of revelry<br>
Where death is bought and sold,<br>
Where at least they get a welcome<br>
Though it's prompted by their gold?</p>

<p>Stranger, did it ever strike you,<br>
When the winter days are gone<br>
And the mortal grass is springing up<br>
To meet the judgment sun,<br>
And we 'tend mighty round-ups<br>
Where, according to the Word,<br>
The angel cowboy of the Lord<br>
Will cut the human herd,&mdash;</p>

<p>That a heap of stock that's lowing now<br>
Around the Master's pen<br>
And feeding at his fodder stack<br>
Will have the brand picked then?<br>
And brands that when the hair was long<br>
Looked like the letter C,<br>
Will prove to be the devil's,<br>
And the brand the letter D;</p>

<p>While many a long-horned coaster,&mdash;<br>
I mean, just so to speak,&mdash;<br>
That hasn't had the advantage<br>
Of the range and gospel creek<br>
Will get to crop the grasses<br>
In the pasture of the Lord<br>
If the letter C showed up<br>
Beneath the devil's checker board.</p>

<p>Now list to my song, it will not take me long,<br>
And in some things with me you'll agree;<br>
A young man so green came in from Moline,<br>
And enlisted a soldier to be.<br>
He had lots of pluck, on himself he was stuck,<br>
In his Government straights he looked "boss,"<br>
And he chewed enough beans for a hoss.</p>

<p class="add1em">He was a rookey, so flukey,<br>
  He was a jim dandy you all will agree,<br>
  He said without fear, "Before I'm a year<br>
  In the Army, great changes you'll see."<br>
  He was a stone thrower, a foam blower,<br>
  He was a Loo Loo you bet,<br>
  He stood on his head and these words gently said,<br>
  "I'll be second George Washington yet."</p>

<p>At his post he did land, they took him in hand,<br>
The old bucks they all gathered 'round,<br>
Saying "Give us your fist; where did you enlist?<br>
You'll take on again I'll be bound;<br>
I've a blanket to sell, it will fit you quite well,<br>
I'll sell you the whole or a piece.<br>
I've a dress coat to trade, or a helmet unmade,<br>
It will do you for kitchen police."</p>

<p>Then <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> the top said, "My Son, here is a gun,<br>
Just heel ball that musket up bright.<br>
In a few days or more you'll be rolling in gore,<br>
A-chasing wild Goo Goos to flight.<br>
There'll be fighting, you see, and blood flowing free,<br>
We'll send you right on to the front;<br>
And never you fear, if you're wounded, my dear,<br>
You'll be pensioned eight dollars per month."</p>

<p>He was worried so bad, he blew in all he had;<br>
He went on a drunk with goodwill.<br>
And the top did report, "One private short."<br>
When he showed up he went to the mill.<br>
The proceedings we find were a ten dollar blind,<br>
Ten dollars less to blow foam.<br>
This was long years ago, and this rookey you know<br>
Is now in the old soldiers' home.</p>

And he's sold him his saddle, his spurs, and his rope,<br>
And there's no more cow punching, and that's what I hope.</p>

<p>My love has a gun that has gone to the bad,<br>
Which makes poor old Jimmy feel pretty damn sad;<br>
For the gun it shoots high and the gun it shoots low,<br>
And it wobbles about like a bucking bronco.</p>

<p>The cook is an unfortunate son of a gun;<br>
He has to be up e'er the rise of the sun;<br>
His language is awful, his curses are deep,&mdash;<br>
He is like cascarets, for he works while you sleep.</p>

<p>I am a jolly shanty boy,<br>
As you will soon discover.<br>
To all the dodges I am fly,<br>
A hustling pine woods rover.<br>
A peavy hook it is my pride,<br>
An ax I well can handle;<br>
To fell a tree or punch a bull<br>
Get rattling Danny Randall.</p>

<p>Bung yer eye: bung yer eye.</p>

<p>I love a girl in Saginaw;<br>
She lives with her mother;<br>
I defy all Michigan<br>
To find such another.<br>
She's tall and fat, her hair is red,<br>
Her face is plump and pretty,<br>
She's my daisy, Sunday-best-day girl,&mdash;<br>
And her front name stands for Kitty.</p>

<p>Bung yer eye: bung yer eye.</p>

<p>I took her to a dance one night,<br>
A mossback gave the bidding;<br>
Silver Jack bossed the shebang<br>
And Big Dan played the fiddle.<br>
We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> danced and drank, the livelong night.<br>
With fights between the dancing&mdash;<br>
Till Silver Jack cleaned out the ranch<br>
And sent the mossbacks prancing.</p>

<p class="tit-song">ROOT HOG OR DIE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span></p>

<p>When I was a young man I lived on the square,<br>
I never had any pocket change and I hardly thought it fair;<br>
So out on the crosses I went to rob and to steal,<br>
And when I met a peddler oh, how happy I did feel.</p>

<p>One morning, one morning, one morning in May<br>
I seen a man a-coming, a little bit far away;<br>
I seen a man a-coming, come riding up to me<br>
"Come here, come here, young fellow, I'm after you to-day."</p>

<p>He taken me to the new jail, he taken me to the new jail,<br>
And I had to walk right in.<br>
There all my friends went back on me<br>
And also my kin.</p>

<p>I had an old rich uncle, who lived in the West,<br>
He heard of my misfortune, it wouldn't let him rest;<br>
He came to see me, he paid my bills and score,&mdash;<br>
I have been a bad boy, I'll do so no more.</p>

<p>There's Minnie and Alice and Lucy likewise,<br>
They heard of my misfortune brought tears to their eyes.<br>
I've <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> told 'em my condition, I've told it o'er and o'er;<br>
So I've been a bad boy, I'll do so no more.</p>

<p>I will go to East Texas to marry me a wife,<br>
And try to maintain her the balance of my life;<br>
I'll try to maintain; I'll lay it up in store<br>
I've been a bad boy, I'll do so no more.</p>

<p>Young man, you robber, you had better take it fair,<br>
Leave off your marshal killing and live on the square;<br>
Should you meet the marshal, just pass him by;<br>
And travel on the muscular, for it's root hog or die.</p>

<p>When I drew my money I drew it all in cash<br>
And off to see my Susan, you bet I cut a dash;<br>
I spent my money freely and went it on a bum,<br>
And I love the pretty women and am bound to have my fun.</p>

<p>I used to sport a white hat, a horse and buggy fine,<br>
Courted a pretty girl and always called her mine;<br>
But all my courtships proved to be in vain,<br>
For they sent me down to Huntsville to wear the ball and chain.</p>

<p>Along came my true love, about twelve o'clock,<br>
Saying, "Henry, O Henry, what sentence have you got?"<br>
The jury found me guilty, the judge would allow no stay,<br>
So they sent me down to Huntsville to wear my life away.</p>

<span class="add2em">"A California Immigrant Song of the Fifties"</span></p>

<p>Oh, don't you remember sweet Betsy from Pike<br>
Who crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike,<br>
And two yoke of cattle, a large yellow dog,<br>
A tall, shanghai rooster, and one spotted hog?<br>
        <span class="add3em">Saying, good-bye, Pike County,</span><br>
        <span class="add3em">Farewell for a while;</span><br>
        <span class="add3em">We'll come back again</span><br>
        <span class="add3em">When we've panned out our pile.</span></p>

<p>One evening quite early they camped on the Platte,<br>
'Twas near by the road on a green shady flat;<br>
Where Betsy, quite tired, lay down to repose,<br>
While with wonder Ike gazed on his Pike County rose.</p>

<p>They soon reached the desert, where Betsy gave out,<br>
And down in the sand she lay rolling about;<br>
While Ike in great terror looked on in surprise,<br>
Saying "Betsy, get up, you'll get sand in your eyes."<br>
        <span class="add3em">Saying, good-bye, Pike County,</span><br>
        <span class="add3em">Farewell for a while;</span><br>
        <span class="add3em">I'd go back to-night</span><br>
        <span class="add3em">If it was but a mile.</span></p>

<p>Sweet <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> Betsy got up in a great deal of pain<br>
And declared she'd go back to Pike County again;<br>
Then Ike heaved a sigh and they fondly embraced,<br>
And she traveled along with his arm around her waist.</p>

<p>The wagon tipped over with a terrible crash,<br>
And out on the prairie rolled all sorts of trash;<br>
A few little baby clothes done up with care<br>
Looked rather suspicious,&mdash;though 'twas all on the square.</p>

<p>The shanghai ran off and the cattle all died,<br>
The last piece of bacon that morning was fried;<br>
Poor Ike got discouraged, and Betsy got mad,<br>
The dog wagged his tail and looked wonderfully sad.</p>

<p>One morning they climbed up a very high hill,<br>
And with wonder looked down into old Placerville;<br>
Ike shouted and said, as he cast his eyes down,<br>
"Sweet Betsy, my darling, we've got to Hangtown."</p>

<p>Long Ike and sweet Betsy attended a dance,<br>
Where Ike wore a pair of his Pike County pants;<br>
Sweet Betsy was covered with ribbons and rings.<br>
Quoth Ike, "You're an angel, but where are your wings?"</p>

<p>A miner <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> said, "Betsy, will you dance with me?"<br>
"I will that, old hoss, if you don't make too free;<br>
But don't dance me hard. Do you want to know why?<br>
Dog on ye, I'm chock full of strong alkali."</p>

<p>Long Ike and sweet Betsy got married of course,<br>
But Ike getting jealous obtained a divorce;<br>
And Betsy, well satisfied, said with a shout,<br>
"Good-bye, you big lummax, I'm glad you backed out."<br>
      <span class="add3em">Saying, good-bye, dear Isaac,</span><br>
      <span class="add3em">Farewell for a while,</span><br>

<p class="tit-song">THE DISHEARTENED RANGER <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span></p>

<p>Come listen to a ranger, you kind-hearted stranger,<br>
This song, though a sad one, you're welcome to hear;<br>
We've kept the Comanches away from your ranches,<br>
And followed them far o'er the Texas frontier.</p>

<p>We're weary of scouting, of traveling, and routing<br>
The blood-thirsty villains o'er prairie and wood;<br>
No rest for the sinner, no breakfast or dinner,<br>
But he lies in a supperless bed in the mud.</p>

<p>No corn nor potatoes, no bread nor tomatoes,<br>
But jerked beef as dry as the sole of your shoe;<br>
All day without drinking, all night without winking,<br>
I'll tell you, kind stranger, this never will do.</p>

<p>Those great alligators, the State legislators,<br>
Are puffing and blowing two-thirds of their time,<br>
But windy orations about rangers and rations<br>
Never put in our pockets one-tenth of a dime.</p>

<p>They do not regard us, they will not reward us,<br>
Though hungry and haggard with holes in our coats;<br>
But the election is coming and they will be drumming<br>
And praising our valor to purchase our votes.</p>

<p>For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> glory and payment, for vittles and raiment,<br>
No longer we'll fight on the Texas frontier.<br>
So guard your own ranches, and mind the Comanches<br>
Or surely they'll scalp you in less than a year.</p>

<p>Though sore it may grieve you, the rangers must leave you<br>
Exposed to the arrows and knife of the foe;<br>
So herd your own cattle and fight your own battle,<br>
For home to the States I'm determined to go,&mdash;</p>

<p>Where churches have steeples and laws are more equal,<br>
Where houses have people and ladies are kind;<br>
Where work is regarded and worth is rewarded;<br>
Where pumpkins are plenty and pockets are lined.</p>

<p>Your wives and your daughters we have guarded from slaughter,<br>
Through conflicts and struggles I shudder to tell;<br>
No more well defend them, to God we'll commend them.<br>
To the frontier of Texas we bid a farewell.</p>

<p>Come all you melancholy folks and listen unto me,<br>
I will sing you about the cowboy whose heart's so light and free;<br>
He roves all over the prairie and at night when he lays down<br>
His heart's as gay as the flowers of May with his bed spread on the ground.</p>

<p>They are a little bit rough, I must confess, the most of them at least;<br>
But as long as you do not cross their trail, you can live with them in peace.<br>
But if you do, they're sure to rule, the day you come to their land,<br>
For they'll follow you up and shoot it out, they'll do it man to man.</p>

<p>You can go to a cowboy hungry, go to him wet or dry,<br>
And ask him for a few dollars in change and he will not deny;<br>
He will pull out his pocket-book and hand you out a note,&mdash;<br>
Oh, they are the fellows to strike, boys, whenever you are broke.</p>

<p>You <span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span> can go to their ranches and often stay for weeks,<br>
And when you go to leave, boys, they'll never charge you a cent;<br>
But when they go to town, boys, you bet their money is spent.<br>
They walk right up, they take their drinks and they pay for every one.<br>
They never ask your pardon, boys, for a thing that they have done.</p>

<p>They go to the ball-room, and swing the pretty girls around;<br>
They ride their bucking broncos, and wear their broad-brimmed hats;<br>
Their California saddles, their pants below their boots,<br>
You can hear their spurs go jing-a-ling, or perhaps somebody shoots.</p>

<p>Come all you soft and tenderfeet, if you want to have some fun,<br>
Come go among the cowboys and they'll show you how it's done;<br>
But take the kind advice of me as I gave it to you before,<br>
For if you don't, they'll order you off with an old Colt's forty-four.</p>

<p>Bob Stanford, he's a Texas boy,<br>
He lives down on the flat;<br>
His trade is running a well-drill,<br>
But he's none the worse for that.</p>

<p>He is neither rich nor handsome,<br>
But, unlike the city dude,<br>
His manners they are pleasant<br>
Instead of flip and rude.</p>

<p>His people live in Texas,<br>
That is his native home,<br>
But like many other Western lads<br>
He drifted off from home.</p>

<p>He came out to New Mexico<br>
A fortune for to make,<br>
He punched the bottom out of the earth<br>
And never made a stake.</p>

<p>So he came to Arizona<br>
And again set up his drill<br>
To punch a hole for water,<br>
And he's punching at it still.</p>

<p>He says he is determined<br>
To make the business stick<br>
Or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> spend that derned old well machine<br>
And all he can get on tick.</p>

<p>I hope he is successful<br>
And I'll help him if I can,<br>
For I admire pluck and ambition<br>
In an honest working man.</p>

<p>So keep on going down,<br>
Punch the bottom out, or try,<br>
There is nothing in a hole in the ground<br>
That continues being dry.</p>

I hope he'll find a resting place within the golden gate.<br>
Another place is vacant on the ranch of the X I T,<br>
'Twill be hard to find another that's liked as well as he.</p>

<p>The first that died was Kid White, a man both tough and brave,<br>
While Charlie Rutlage makes the third to be sent to his grave,<br>
Caused by a cow-horse falling while running after stock;<br>
'Twas on the spring round-up,&mdash;a place where death men mock.</p>

<p>He went forward one morning on a circle through the hills,<br>
He was gay and full of glee, and free from earthly ills;<br>
But when it came to finish up the work on which he went,<br>
Nothing came back from him; for his time on earth was spent.</p>

<p>'Twas <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> as he rode the round-up, an X I T turned back to the herd;<br>
Poor Charlie shoved him in again, his cutting horse he spurred;<br>
Another turned; at that moment his horse the creature spied<br>
And turned and fell with him, and beneath, poor Charlie died.</p>

<p>His relations in Texas his face never more will see,<br>
But I hope he will meet his loved ones beyond in eternity.<br>
I hope he will meet his parents, will meet them face to face,<br>
And that they will grasp him by the right hand at the shining throne of grace.</p>

I will relate you a story of the deepest distress,&mdash;<br>
I love my poor Lulu, boys, of all girls the best.</p>

<p>When you are out riding, boys, upon the highway,<br>
Meet a fair damsel, a lady so gay,<br>
With her red, rosy cheeks and her sparkling dark eyes,<br>
Just think of my Lulu, boys, and your bosoms will rise.</p>

<p>While you live single, boys, you are just in your prime;<br>
You have no wife to scold, you have nothing to bother your minds;<br>
You can roam this world over and do just as you will,<br>
Hug and kiss the pretty girls and be your own still.</p>

<p>But when you get married, boys, you are done with this life,<br>
You have sold your sweet comfort for to gain you a wife;<br>
Your <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> wife she will scold you, and the children will cry,<br>
It will make those fair faces look withered and dry.</p>

<p>You can scarcely step aside, boys, to speak to a friend<br>
But your wife is at your elbow saying what do you mean.<br>
With her nose turned upon you it will look like sad news,&mdash;<br>
I advise you by experience that life to refuse.</p>

<p>Come fill up your bottles, boys, drink Bourbon around;<br>
Here is luck to the single wherever they are found.<br>
Here is luck to the single and I wish them success,<br>
Likewise to the married ones, I wish them no less.</p>

<p>I have one more request to make, boys, before we part.<br>
Never place your affection on a charming sweetheart.<br>
She is dancing before you your affections to gain;<br>
Just turn your back on them with scorn and disdain.</p>


<p class="tit-song">HER WHITE BOSOM BARE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span></p>

<p>The sun had gone down<br>
O'er the hills of the west,<br>
And the last beams had faded<br>
O'er the mossy hill's crest,<br>
O'er the beauties of nature<br>
And the charms of the fair,<br>
And Amanda was bound<br>
With her white bosom bare.</p>

<p>At the foot of the mountain<br>
Amanda did sigh<br>
At the hoot of an owl<br>
Or the catamount's cry;<br>
Or the howl of some wolf<br>
In its low, granite cell,<br>
Or the crash of some large<br>
Forest tree as it fell.</p>

<p>Amanda was there<br>
All friendless and forlorn<br>
With her face bathed in blood<br>
And her garments all torn.<br>
The sunlight had faded<br>
O'er the hills of the green,<br>
And fierce was the look<br>
Of the wild, savage scene.</p>

<p>For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span> it was out in the forest<br>
Where the wild game springs,<br>
Where low in the branches<br>
The rude hammock swings;<br>
The campfire was kindled,<br>
Well fanned by the breeze,<br>
And the light of the campfire<br>
Shone round on the trees.</p>

<p>The campfire was kindled,<br>
Well fanned by the breeze,<br>
And the light of the fire<br>
Shone round on the trees;<br>
And grim stood the circle<br>
Of the warrior throng,<br>
Impatient to join<br>
In the war-dance and song.</p>

<p>The campfire was kindled,<br>
Each warrior was there,<br>
And Amanda was bound<br>
With her white bosom bare.<br>
She counted the vengeance<br>
In the face of her foes<br>
And sighed for the moment<br>
When her sufferings might close.</p>

<p>Young Albon, he gazed<br>
On the face of the fair<br>
While her dark hazel eyes<br>
Were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> uplifted in prayer;<br>
And her dark waving tresses<br>
In ringlets did flow<br>
Which hid from the gazer<br>
A bosom of snow.</p>

<p>Then young Albon, the chief<br>
Of the warriors, drew near,<br>
With an eye like an eagle<br>
And a step like a deer.<br>
"Forbear," cried he,<br>
"Your torture forbear;<br>
This maiden shall live.<br>
By my wampum I swear.</p>

<p>"It is for this maiden's freedom<br>
That I do crave;<br>
Give a sigh for her suffering<br>
Or a tear for her grave.<br>
If there is a victim<br>
To be burned at that tree,<br>
Young Albon, your leader,<br>
That victim shall be."</p>

<p>Then quick to the arms<br>
Of Amanda he rushed;<br>
The rebel was dead,<br>
And the tumult was hushed;<br>
And grim stood the circle<br>
Of warriors around<br>
While <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> the cords of Amanda<br>
Young Albon unbound.</p>

<p>So it was early next morning<br>
The red, white, and blue<br>
Went gliding o'er the waters<br>
In a small birch canoe;<br>
Just like the white swan<br>
That glides o'er the tide,<br>
Young Albon and Amanda<br>
O'er the waters did ride.</p>

<p>O'er the blue, bubbling water,<br>
Neath the evergreen trees,<br>
Young Albon and Amanda<br>
Did ride at their ease;<br>
And great was the joy<br>
When she stepped on the shore<br>
To embrace her dear father<br>
And mother once more.</p>

<p>Young Albon, he stood<br>
And enjoyed their embrace,<br>
With a sigh in his heart<br>
And a tear on his face;<br>
And all that he asked<br>
Was kindness and food<br>
From the parents of Amanda<br>
To the chief of the woods.</p>

<p>Young <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> Amanda is home now,<br>
As you all know,<br>
Enjoying the friends<br>
Of her own native shore;<br>
Nevermore will she roam<br>
O'er the hills or the plains;<br>
She praises the chief<br>
That loosened her chains.</p>

<p>My name is Juan Murray, and hard for my fate,<br>
I was born and raised in Texas, that good old lone star state.<br>
I have been to many a round-up, boys, have worked on the trail,<br>
Have stood many a long old guard through the rain, yes, sleet, and hail;<br>
I have rode the Texas broncos that pitched from morning till noon,<br>
And have seen many a storm, boys, between sunrise, yes, and noon.</p>

<p>I am a jolly cowboy and have roamed all over the West,<br>
And among the bronco riders I rank among the best.<br>
But when I left old Midland, with voice right then I spoke,&mdash;<br>
"I never will see you again until the day I croak."</p><br>

<p>But since I left old Texas so many sights I have saw<br>
A-traveling from my native state way out to Mexico,&mdash;<br>
I am looking all around me and cannot help but smile<br>
To see my nearest neighbors all in the Mexican style.</p>

<p>I left <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> my home in Texas to dodge the ball and chain.<br>
In the State of Sonora I will forever remain.<br>
Farewell to my mother, my friends that are so dear,<br>
I would like to see you all again, my lonesome heart to cheer.</p>

<p>I have a word to speak, boys, only another to say,&mdash;<br>
Don't never be a cow-thief, don't never ride a stray;<br>
Be careful of your line, boys, and keep it on your tree,&mdash;<br>
Just suit yourself about it, for it is nothing to me.</p>

<p>But if you start to rustling you will come to some sad fate,<br>
You will have to go to prison and work for the state.<br>
Don't think that I am lying and trying to tell a joke,<br>
For the writer has experienced just every word he's spoke.</p>

<p>It is better to be honest and let other's stock alone<br>
Than to leave your native country and seek a Mexican home.<br>
For if you start to rustling you will surely come to see<br>
The State of Sonora,&mdash;be an outcast just like me.</p>

A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> gay little centipede, all without fear,<br>
Crawls over my pillow and into my ear.</p>

And chew your hard tack till you're toothless and gray;<br>
But for myself, I'll no longer remain<br>
To starve like a dog on my government claim.</p>

<p>My clothes are all ragged as my language is rough,<br>
My bread is corn dodgers, both solid and tough;<br>
But yet I am happy, and live at my ease<br>
On sorghum molasses, bacon, and cheese.</p>

<p>Good-bye to Greer County where blizzards arise,<br>
Where the sun never sinks and a flea never dies,<br>
And the wind never ceases but always remains<br>
Till it starves us all out on our government claims.</p>

<p>Farewell to Greer County, farewell to the West,<br>
I'll travel back East to the girl I love best,<br>
I'll travel back to Texas and marry me a wife,<br>
And quit corn bread for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I live for the good of my nation<br>
And my sons are all growing low,<br>
But I hope that my next generation<br>
Will resemble Old Rosin the Bow.</p>

<p>I have traveled this wide world all over,<br>
And now to another I'll go,<br>
For I know that good quarters are waiting<br>
To welcome Old Rosin the Bow.</p>

<p>The gay round of delights I have traveled,<br>
Nor will I behind leave a woe,<br>
For while my companions are jovial<br>
They'll drink to Old Rosin the Bow.</p>

All will at last be so,<br>
Then we'll take a full bumper at parting<br>

<p>When I am laid out on the counter,<br>
And the people all anxious to know,<br>
Just raise up the lid of the coffin<br>
And look at Old Rosin the Bow.</p>

<p>And when through the streets my friends bear me,<br>
And the ladies are filled with deep woe,<br>
They'll <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> come to the doors and the windows<br>
And sigh for Old Rosin the Bow.</p>

<p>Then get some fine, jovial fellows,<br>
And let them all staggering go;<br>
Then dig a deep hole in the meadow<br>
And in it toss Rosin the Bow.</p>

<p>Then get a couple of dornicks,<br>
Place one at my head and my toe,<br>
And do not forget to scratch on them,<br>
"Here lies Old Rosin the Bow."</p>

<p>Then let those same jovial fellows<br>
Surround my lone grave in a row,<br>
While they drink from my favorite bottle<br>
The health of Old Rosin the Bow.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE GREAT ROUND-UP <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span></p>

<p>When I think of the last great round-up<br>
On the eve of eternity's dawn,<br>
I think of the past of the cowboys<br>
Who have been with us here and are gone.<br>
And I wonder if any will greet me<br>
On the sands of the evergreen shore<br>
With a hearty, "God bless you, old fellow,"<br>
That I've met with so often before.</p>

<p>I think of the big-hearted fellows<br>
Who will divide with you blanket and bread,<br>
With a piece of stray beef well roasted,<br>
And charge for it never a red.<br>
I often look upward and wonder<br>
If the green fields will seem half so fair,<br>
If any the wrong trail have taken<br>
And fail to "be in" over there.</p>

<p>For the trail that leads down to perdition<br>
Is paved all the way with good deeds,<br>
But in the great round-up of ages,<br>
Dear boys, this won't answer your needs.<br>
But the way to the green pastures, though narrow,<br>
Leads straight to the home in the sky,<br>
And Jesus will give you the passports<br>
To the land of the sweet by and by.</p>

<p>For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> the Savior has taken the contract<br>
To deliver all those who believe,<br>
At the headquarters ranch of his Father,<br>
In the great range where none can deceive.<br>
The Inspector will stand at the gateway<br>
And the herd, one by one, will go by,&mdash;<br>
The round-up by the angels in judgment<br>
Must pass 'neath his all-seeing eye.</p>

<p>No maverick or slick will be tallied<br>
In the great book of life in his home,<br>
For he knows all the brands and the earmarks<br>
That down through the ages have come.<br>
But, along with the tailings and sleepers,<br>
The strays must turn from the gate;<br>
No road brand to gain them admission,<br>
But the awful sad cry "too late."</p>

<p>Yet I trust in the last great round-up<br>
When the rider shall cut the big herd,<br>
That the cowboys shall be represented<br>
In the earmark and brand of the Lord,<br>
To be shipped to the bright, mystic regions<br>
Over there in green pastures to lie,<br>
And led by the crystal still waters<br>
In that home of the sweet by and by.</p>

<p>My lover, he is a cowboy, he's brave and kind and true,<br>
He rides a Spanish pony, he throws a lasso, too;<br>
And when he comes to see me our vows we do redeem,<br>
He throws his arms around me and thus begins to sing:</p>

   <p class="add2em">"Ho, I'm a jolly cowboy, from Texas now I hail,<br>
    Give me my quirt and pony, I'm ready for the trail;<br>
    I love the rolling prairies, they're free from care and strife,<br>
    Behind a herd of longhorns I'll journey all my life.</p>

<p>"When early dawn is breaking and we are far away,<br>
We fall into our saddles, we round-up all the day;<br>
We rope, we brand, we ear-mark, I tell you we are smart,<br>
And when the herd is ready, for Kansas then we start.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am a Texas cowboy, lighthearted, brave, and free,<br>
To roam the wide, wide prairie, 'tis always joy to me.<br>
My <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> trusty little pony is my companion true,<br>
O'er creeks and hills and rivers he's sure to pull me through.</p>

<p>"When threatening clouds do gather and herded lightnings flash,<br>
And heavy rain drops splatter, and rolling thunders crash;<br>
What keeps the herd from running, stampeding far and wide?<br>
The cowboy's long, low whistle and singing by their side.</p>

<p>"When in Kansas City, our boss he pays us up,<br>
We loaf around the city and take a parting cup;<br>
We bid farewell to city life, from noisy crowds we come,<br>
And back to dear old Texas, the cowboy's native home."</p>

<p>Oh, he is coming back to marry the only girl he loves,<br>
He says I am his darling, I am his own true love;<br>
Some day we two will marry and then no more he'll roam,<br>
But settle down with Mary in a cozy little home.</p>

   <p class="add2em">"Ho, I'm a jolly cowboy, from Texas now I hail,<br>
    Give me my bond to Mary, I'll quit the Lone Star trail.<br>
    I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span> love the rolling prairies, they're free from care and strife,<br>

<p class="tit-song">THE COWBOY'S MEDITATION <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span></p>

<p>At midnight when the cattle are sleeping<br>
On my saddle I pillow my head,<br>
And up at the heavens lie peeping<br>
From out of my cold, grassy bed,&mdash;<br>
Often and often I wondered<br>
At night when lying alone<br>
If every bright star up yonder<br>
Is a big peopled world like our own.</p>

<p>Are they worlds with their ranges and ranches?<br>
Do they ring with rough rider refrains?<br>
Do the cowboys scrap there with Comanches<br>
And other Red Men of the plains?<br>
Are the hills covered over with cattle<br>
In those mystic worlds far, far away?<br>
Do the ranch-houses ring with the prattle<br>
Of sweet little children at play?</p>

<p>At night in the bright stars up yonder<br>
Do the cowboys lie down to their rest?<br>
Do they gaze at this old world and wonder<br>
If rough riders dash over its breast?<br>
Do they list to the wolves in the canyons?<br>
Do they watch the night owl in its flight,<br>
With their horse their only companion<br>
While guarding the herd through the night?</p>

<p>Sometimes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>(p. 298)</span> when a bright star is twinkling<br>
Like a diamond set in the sky,<br>
I find myself lying and thinking,<br>
It may be God's heaven is nigh.<br>
I wonder if there I shall meet her,<br>
My mother whom God took away;<br>
If in the star-heavens I'll greet her<br>
At the round-up that's on the last day.</p>

<p>In the east the great daylight is breaking<br>
And into my saddle I spring;<br>
The cattle from sleep are awakening,<br>
The heaven-thoughts from me take wing,<br>
The eyes of my bronco are flashing,<br>
Impatient he pulls at the reins,<br>
And off round the herd I go dashing,<br>
A reckless cowboy of the plains.</p>


<p class="tit-song">BILLY VENERO <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span></p>

<p>Billy Venero heard them say,<br>
In an Arizona town one day.<br>
That a band of Apache Indians were upon the trail of death;<br>
Heard them tell of murder done,<br>
Three men killed at Rocky Run,<br>
"They're in danger at the cow-ranch," said Venero, under breath.</p>

<p>Cow-Ranch, forty miles away,<br>
Was a little place that lay<br>
In a deep and shady valley of the mighty wilderness;<br>
Half a score of homes were there,<br>
And in one a maiden fair<br>
Held the heart of Billy Venero, Billy Venero's little Bess.</p>

<p>So no wonder he grew pale<br>
When he heard the cowboy's tale<br>
Of the men that he'd seen murdered the day before at Rocky Run.<br>
"Sure as there's a God above,<br>
I will save the girl I love;<br>
By my love for little Bessie I will see that something's done."</p>

<p>Not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> a moment he delayed<br>
When his brave resolve was made.<br>
"Why man," his comrades told him when they heard of his daring plan,<br>
"You are riding straight to death."<br>
But he answered, "Save your breath;<br>
I may never reach the cow-ranch but I'll do the best I can."</p>

<p>As he crossed the alkali<br>
All his thoughts flew on ahead<br>
To the little band at cow-ranch thinking not of danger near;<br>
With his quirt's unceasing whirl<br>
And the jingle of his spurs<br>
Little brown Chapo bore the cowboy o'er the far away frontier.</p>

<p>Lower and lower sank the sun;<br>
He drew rein at Rocky Run;<br>
"Here those men met death, my Chapo," and he stroked his glossy mane;<br>
"So shall those we go to warn<br>
Ere the coming of the morn<br>
If we fail,&mdash;God help my Bessie," and he started on again.</p>

<p>Sharp and clear a rifle shot<br>
Woke the echoes of the spot.<br>
"I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span> am wounded," cried Venero, as he swayed from side to side;<br>
"While there's life there's always hope;<br>
Slowly onward I will lope,&mdash;<br>
If I fail to reach the cow-ranch, Bessie Lee shall know I tried.</p>

<p>"I will save her yet," he cried,<br>
"Bessie Lee shall know I tried,"<br>
And for her sake then he halted in the shadow of a hill;<br>
From his chapareras he took<br>
With weak hands a little book;<br>
Tore a blank leaf from its pages saying, "This shall be my will."</p>

<p>From a limb a pen he broke,<br>
And he dipped his pen of oak<br>
In the warm blood that was spurting from a wound above his heart.<br>
"Rouse," he wrote before too late;<br>
"Apache warriors lie in wait.<br>
Good-bye, Bess, God bless you darling," and he felt the cold tears start.</p>

<p>Then he made his message fast,<br>
Love's first message and its last,<br>
To the saddle horn he tied it and his lips were white with pain,<br>
"Take this message, if not me,<br>
Straight <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> to little Bessie Lee;"<br>
Then he tied himself to the saddle, and he gave his horse the rein.</p>

<p>Just at dusk a horse of brown<br>
Wet with sweat came panting down<br>
The little lane at the cow-ranch, stopped in front of Bessie's door;<br>
But the cowboy was asleep,<br>
And his slumbers were so deep,<br>
Little Bess could never wake him though she tried for evermore.</p>

<p>You have heard the story told<br>
By the young and by the old,<br>
Away down yonder at the cow-ranch the night the Apaches came;<br>
Of that sharp and bloody fight,<br>
How the chief fell in the fight<br>
And the panic-stricken warriors when they heard Venero's name.</p>

<p>And the heavens and earth between<br>
Keep a little flower so green<br>
That little Bess had planted ere they laid her by his side.</p>

<p>Come, all you old cowpunchers, a story I will tell,<br>
And if you'll all be quiet, I sure will sing it well;<br>

<p>Back in the day when I was young, I knew a man named Hods;<br>
He wasn't fit fer nothin' 'cep turnin' up the clods.</p>

<p>But he came west in fifty-three, behind a pair of mules,<br>
And 'twas hard to tell between the three which was the biggest fools.</p>

Oh, he sure did get in trouble,&mdash;and old Hodsie wasn't no man.</p>

<p>He met a bunch of Indian bucks led by Geronimo,<br>
And what them Indians did to him, well, shorely I don't know.</p>

Oh, I can tip the lasso, it is with graceful ease;<br>
I rope a streak of lightning, and ride it where I please.<br>

<p>The sun circles upward; the steers as they plod<br>
Are pounding to powder the hot prairie sod;<br>
And it seems as the dust makes you dizzy and sick<br>
That we'll never reach noon and the cool, shady creek.<br>

Let them loaf if they will, for the railroad's in sight<br>

First comes the cowboy, he is pointed for the west;<br>
Of all the pioneers I claim the cowboys are the best;<br>
You will miss him on the round-up, it's gone, his merry shout,&mdash;<br>

Can't drag your loads for nothing through the gumbo and the sand.<br>
The railroads are bound to beat you when you do your level best;<br>
So give it up to the grangers and strike out for the west.<br>
Bid them all adieu and give the merry shout,&mdash;<br>

When <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span> I think of the tin can by the fire and the cayote on the hill.<br>

Our pockets full of money, not a sorrow did we know.<br>
But things have changed now, we are poorly clothed and fed.<br>
Our wagons are all broken and our ponies most all dead.<br>
Soon we will leave this country, you'll hear the angels shout,<br>

Kind of cute and smart and tonguey<br>

<p>He could talk on any subject<br>
From the Bible down to Hoyle,<br>

Just as smooth and slick as oil,<br>
He was what they call a skeptic,<br>
And he loved to sit and weave<br>
Hifalutin' words together<br>
Tellin' what he didn't believe.</p>

<p>One day we all were sittin' round<br>
Smokin' nigger head tobacco<br>

"And you've got to take it back."<br>
Then everybody started,&mdash;<br>
'Twas the words of Silver Jack.<br>
And he cracked his fists together<br>
And he stacked his duds and cried,<br>
"'Twas in that thar religion<br>

And he answered bold and free:<br>
"Stack your duds and cut your capers,<br>
For there ain't no flies on me."<br>
And they fit for forty minutes<br>
And the crowd would whoop and cheer<br>
When Jack spit up a tooth or two,<br>
Or when Bobby lost an ear.</p>

<p>But at last Jack got him under<br>
And he slugged him onct or twict,<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> straightway Bob admitted<br>
The divinity of Christ.<br>
But Jack kept reasoning with him<br>
Till the poor cuss gave a yell<br>
And lowed he'd been mistaken<br>
In his views concerning hell.</p>

<p>Then the fierce encounter ended<br>
And they riz up from the ground<br>
And someone brought a bottle out<br>
And kindly passed it round.<br>
And we drank to Bob's religion<br>
In a cheerful sort o' way,<br>
But the spread of infidelity<br>
Was checked in camp that day.</p>

<p>Way out in Western Texas, where the Clear Fork's waters flow,<br>
Where the cattle are a-browzin' and the Spanish ponies grow;<br>
Where the Northers come a-whistlin' from beyond the Neutral Strip;<br>
And the prairie dogs are sneezin', as though they had the grip;<br>
Where the coyotes come a-howlin' round the ranches after dark,<br>
And the mockin' birds are singin' to the lovely medder lark;<br>
Where the 'possum and the badger and the rattlesnakes abound,<br>
And the monstrous stars are winkin' o'er a wilderness profound;<br>
Where lonesome, tawny prairies melt into airy streams,<br>
While <span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> the Double Mountains slumber in heavenly kinds of dreams;<br>
Where the antelope is grazin' and the lonely plovers call,&mdash;<br>
It was there I attended the Cowboy's Christmas Ball.</p>

<p>The town was Anson City, old Jones' county seat,<br>
Where they raised Polled Angus cattle and waving whiskered wheat;<br>
Where the air is soft and bammy and dry and full of health,<br>
Where the prairies is explodin' with agricultural wealth;<br>
Where they print the <i>Texas Western</i>, that Hec McCann supplies<br>
With news and yarns and stories, of most amazing size;<br>
Where Frank Smith "pulls the badger" on knowing tenderfeet,<br>
And Democracy's triumphant and mighty hard to beat;<br>
Where lives that good old hunter, John Milsap, from Lamar,<br>
Who used to be the sheriff "back east in Paris, sah"!<br>
'Twas there, I say, at Anson with the lovely Widder Wall,<br>
That I went to that reception, the Cowboy's Christmas Ball.</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles;<br>
The ladies, kinder scatterin', had gathered in for miles.<br>
And yet the place was crowded, as I remember well,<br>
'Twas gave on this occasion at the Morning Star Hotel.<br>
The music was a fiddle and a lively tambourine,<br>
And a viol came imported, by the stage from Abilene.<br>
The room was togged out gorgeous&mdash;with mistletoe and shawls,<br>
And the candles flickered festious, around the airy walls.<br>
The wimmen folks looked lovely&mdash;the boys looked kinder treed,<br>
Till the leader commenced yelling, "Whoa, fellers, let's stampede,"<br>
And the music started sighing and a-wailing through the hall<br>
As a kind of introduction to the Cowboy's Christmas Ball.</p>

<p>The leader was a feller that came from Swenson's ranch,&mdash;<br>
They called him Windy Billy from Little Deadman's Branch.<br>
His rig was kinder keerless,&mdash;big spurs and high heeled boots;<br>
He had the reputation that comes when fellers shoots.<br>
His <span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span> voice was like the bugle upon the mountain height;<br>
His feet were animated, and a mighty movin' sight,<br>
When he commenced to holler, "Now fellers, shake your pen!<br>
Lock horns ter all them heifers and rustle them like men;<br>
Saloot yer lovely critters; neow swing and let 'em go;<br>
Climb the grapevine round 'em; neow all hands do-ce-do!<br>
You maverick, jine the round-up,&mdash;jes skip the waterfall,"<br>
Huh! hit was getting active, the Cowboy's Christmas Ball.</p>

<p>The boys was tolerable skittish, the ladies powerful neat,<br>
That old bass viol's music just got there with both feet!<br>
That wailin', frisky fiddle, I never shall forget;<br>
And Windy kept a-singin'&mdash;I think I hear him yet&mdash;<br>
"Oh, X's, chase yer squirrels, and cut 'em to our side;<br>
Spur Treadwell to the center, with Cross P Charley's bride,<br>
Doc Hollis down the center, and twine the ladies' chain,<br>
Van Andrews, pen the fillies in big T Diamond's train.<br>
All <span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>(p. 339)</span> pull your freight together, neow swallow fork and change;<br>
Big Boston, lead the trail herd through little Pitchfork's range.<br>
Purr round yer gentle pussies, neow rope and balance all!"<br>
Huh! Hit were gettin' active&mdash;the Cowboy's Christmas Ball.</p>

<p>The dust riz fast and furious; we all jes galloped round,<br>
Till the scenery got so giddy that T Bar Dick was downed.<br>
We buckled to our partners and told 'em to hold on,<br>
Then shook our hoofs like lightning until the early dawn.<br>
Don't tell me 'bout cotillions, or germans. No sir-ee!<br>
That whirl at Anson City jes takes the cake with me.<br>
I'm sick of lazy shufflin's, of them I've had my fill,<br>
Give me a frontier break-down backed up by Windy Bill.<br>
McAllister ain't nowhere, when Windy leads the show;<br>
I've seen 'em both in harness and so I ought ter know.<br>
Oh, Bill, I shan't forget yer, and I oftentimes recall<br>
That lively gaited sworray&mdash;the Cowboy's Christmas Ball.</p>

When I leave them to join the rodero.<br>
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Pinto, whoa!</p>

<p>I am a vaquero, and here I reside;<br>
Show me the broncho I cannot ride.<br>
They say old Pinto with one split ear<br>
Is the hardest jumping broncho on the rodero.<br>
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Pinto, whoa!</p>

<p>There strayed to our camp an iron gray colt;<br>
The boys were all fraid him so on him I bolt.<br>
You bet I stayed with him till cheer after cheer,&mdash;<br>
"He's the broncho twister that's on the rodero."<br>
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Pinto, whoa!</p>

<p class="tit-song">THE GAL I LEFT BEHIND ME <span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>(p. 342)</span></p>

<p>I struck the trail in seventy-nine,<br>

As I jogged along my mind ran back<br>
For the gal I left behind me.<br>
    <span class="add2em">That sweet little gal, that true little gal,</span><br>

He was always after Greasers<br>
And kept 'em on the run.</p>

<p>He shot one every morning,<br>
For to make his morning meal.<br>
And let a white man sass him,<br>
He was shore to feel his steel.</p>

<p>He kept folks in hot water,<br>
And he stole from many a stage;<br>
And when he was full of liquor<br>
He was always in a rage.</p>

<p class="tit-song">THE HELL-BOUND TRAIN <span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span></p>

<p>A Texas cowboy lay down on a bar-room floor.<br>
Having drunk so much he could drink no more;<br>
So he fell asleep with a troubled brain<br>
To dream that he rode on a hell-bound train.</p>

<p>The engine with murderous blood was damp<br>
And was brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp;<br>
An imp, for fuel, was shoveling bones,<br>
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans.</p>

<p>The boiler was filled with lager beer<br>
And the devil himself was the engineer;<br>
The passengers were a most motley crew,&mdash;<br>
Church member, atheist, Gentile, and Jew,</p>

<p>Rich men in broadcloth, beggars in rags,<br>
Handsome young ladies, and withered old hags,<br>
Yellow and black men, red, brown, and white.<br>
All chained together,&mdash;O God, what a sight!</p>

<p>While the train rushed on at an awful pace,<br>
The sulphurous fumes scorched their hands and face;<br>
Wider and wider the country grew,<br>
As faster and faster the engine flew.</p>

<p>Louder <span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span> and louder the thunder crashed<br>
And brighter and brighter the lightning flashed;<br>
Hotter and hotter the air became<br>
Till the clothes were burnt from each quivering frame.</p>

<p>And out of the distance there arose a yell,<br>
"Ha, ha," said the devil, "we're nearing hell!"<br>
Then oh, how the passengers all shrieked with pain<br>
And begged the devil to stop the train.</p>

<p>But he capered about and danced for glee<br>
And laughed and joked at their misery.<br>
"My faithful friends, you have done the work<br>
And the devil never can a payday shirk.</p>

<p>"You've bullied the weak, you've robbed the poor;<br>
The starving brother you've turned from the door,<br>
You've laid up gold where the canker rust,<br>
And have given free vent to your beastly lust.</p>

<p>"You've justice scorned, and corruption sown,<br>
And trampled the laws of nature down.<br>
You have drunk, rioted, cheated, plundered, and lied,<br>
And mocked at God in your hell-born pride.</p>

<p>"You have paid full fare so I'll carry you through;<br>
For it's only right you should have your due.<br>
Why, the laborer always expects his hire,<br>
So I'll land you safe in the lake of fire.</p>

<p>"Where <span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span> your flesh will waste in the flames that roar,<br>
And my imps torment you forever more."<br>
Then the cowboy awoke with an anguished cry,<br>
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high.</p>

<p>Then he prayed as he never had prayed till that hour<br>
To be saved from his sin and the demon's power.<br>
And his prayers and his vows were not in vain;<br>
For he never rode the hell-bound train.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE OLD SCOUT'S LAMENT <span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>(p. 348)</span></p>

<p>Come all of you, my brother scouts,<br>
And listen to my song;<br>
Come, let us sing together<br>
Though the shadows fall so long.</p>

<p>Of all the old frontiersmen<br>
That used to scour the plain<br>
There are but very few of them<br>
That with us yet remain.</p>

<p>Day after day they're dropping off,<br>
They're going one by one;<br>
Our clan is fast decreasing,<br>
Our race is almost run.</p>

<p>There are many of our number<br>
That never wore the blue,<br>
But faithfully they did their part<br>
As brave men, tried and true.</p>

<p>They never joined the army,<br>
But had other work to do<br>
In piloting the coming folks,<br>
To help them safely through.</p>

<p>But <span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>(p. 349)</span> brothers, we are failing,<br>
Our race is almost run;<br>
The days of elk and buffalo<br>
And beaver traps are gone&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, the days of elk and buffalo!<br>
It fills my heart with pain<br>
To know these days are past and gone<br>
To never come again.</p>

<p>We fought the red-skin rascals<br>
Over valley, hill, and plain;<br>
We fought him in the mountain top,<br>
We fought him down again.</p>

<p>These fighting days are over.<br>
The Indian yell resounds<br>
No more along the border;<br>
Peace sends far sweeter sounds.</p>

<p>But we found great joy, old comrades,<br>
To hear and make it die;<br>
We won bright homes for gentle ones,<br>
And now, our West, good-bye.</p>

<p class="tit-song">THE COWBOY AT WORK <span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span></p>

<p>You may call the cowboy horned and think him hard to tame,<br>
You may heap vile epithets upon his head;<br>
But to know him is to like him, notwithstanding his hard name,<br>
For he will divide with you his beef and bread.</p>

<p>If you see him on his pony as he scampers o'er the plain,<br>
You would think him wild and woolly, to be sure;<br>
But his heart is warm and tender when he sees a friend in need,<br>
Though his education is but to endure.</p>

<p>When the storm breaks in its fury and the lightning's vivid flash<br>
Makes you thank the Lord for shelter and for bed,<br>
Then it is he mounts his pony and away you see him dash,<br>
No protection but the hat upon his head.</p>

<p>Such is life upon a cow ranch, and the half was never told;<br>
But you never find a kinder-hearted set<br>
Than <span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span> the cattleman at home, be he either young or old,<br>
He's a "daisy from away back," don't forget.</p>

<p>When you fail to find a pony or a cow that's gone a-stray,<br>
Be that cow or pony wild or be it tame,<br>
The cowboy, like the drummer,&mdash;and the bed-bug, too, they say,&mdash;<br>
Brings him to you, for he gets there just the same.</p>

<p>He leaves unplowed his furrow,<br>
He leaves his books unread<br>
For a life of tented freedom<br>
By lure of danger led.<br>
He's first in the hour of peril,<br>
He's gayest in the dance,<br>
Like the guardsman of old England<br>
Or the beau sabreur of France.</p>

<p>He stands our faithful bulwark<br>
Against our savage foe;<br>
Through lonely woodland places<br>
Our children come and go;<br>
Our flocks and herds untended<br>
O'er hill and valley roam,<br>
The Ranger in the saddle<br>
Means peace for us at home.</p>

<p>Behold our smiling farmsteads<br>
Where waves the golden grain!<br>
Beneath yon tree, earth's bosom<br>
Was dark with crimson stain.<br>
That bluff the death-shot echoed<br>
Of husband, father, slain!<br>
God <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>(p. 355)</span> grant such sight of horror<br>
We never see again!</p>

<p>The gay and hardy Ranger,<br>
His blanket on the ground,<br>
Lies by the blazing camp-fire<br>
While song and tale goes round;<br>
And if one voice is silent,<br>
One fails to hear the jest,<br>
They know his thoughts are absent<br>
With her who loves him best.</p>

<p>Our state, her sons confess it,<br>
That queenly, star-crowned brow,<br>
Has darkened with the shadow<br>
Of lawlessness ere now;<br>
And men of evil passions<br>
On her reproach have laid,<br>
But that the ready Ranger<br>
Rode promptly to her aid.</p>

<p>He may not win the laurel<br>
Nor trumpet tongue of fame;<br>
But beauty smiles upon him,<br>
And ranchmen bless his name.<br>
Then here's to the Texas Ranger,<br>
Past, present and to come!<br>
Our safety from the savage,<br>
The guardian of our home.</p>

<p>Yes, muster them out, the valiant band<br>
That guards our western home.<br>
What matter to you in your eastern land<br>
If the raiders here should come?<br>
No danger that you shall awake at night<br>
To the howls of a savage band;<br>
So muster them out, though the morning light<br>
Find havoc on every hand.</p>

<p>Some dear one is sick and the horses all gone,<br>
So we can't for a doctor send;<br>
The outlaws were in in the light of the morn<br>
And no Rangers here to defend.<br>
For they've mustered them out, the brave true band,<br>
Untiring by night and day.<br>
The fearless scouts of this border land<br>
Made the taxes high, they say.</p>

<p>Have fewer men in the capitol walls,<br>
Fewer tongues in the war of words,<br>
But add to the Rangers, the living wall<br>
That keeps back the bandit hordes.<br>
Have fewer dinners, less turtle soup,<br>
If the taxes are too high.<br>
There <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>(p. 357)</span> are many other and better ways<br>
To lower them if they try.</p>

<p>Don't waste so much of your money<br>
Printing speeches people don't read.<br>
If you'd only take off what's used for that<br>
'Twould lower the tax indeed.<br>
Don't use so much sugar and lemons;<br>
Cold water is just as good<br>
For a constant drink in the summer time<br>
And better for the blood.</p>

<p>But leave us the Rangers to guard us still,<br>
Nor think that they cost too dear;<br>
For their faithful watch over vale and hill<br>
Gives our loved ones naught to fear.</p>

<p>Oh, the prairie dogs are screaming,<br>
And the birds are on the wing,<br>
See the heel fly chase the heifer, boys!<br>
'Tis the first class sign of spring.<br>
The elm wood is budding,<br>
The earth is turning green.<br>
See the pretty things of nature<br>
That make life a pleasant dream!</p>

<p>I'm just living through the winter<br>
To enjoy the coming change,<br>
For there is no place so homelike<br>
As a cow camp on the range.<br>
The boss is smiling radiant,<br>
Radiant as the setting sun;<br>
For he knows he's stealing glories,<br>
For he ain't a-cussin' none.</p>

<p>The cook is at the chuck-box<br>
Whistling "Heifers in the Green,"<br>
Making baking powder biscuits, boys,<br>
While the pot is biling beans.<br>
The boys untie their bedding<br>
And unroll it on the run,<br>
For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>(p. 359)</span> they are in a monstrous hurry<br>
For the supper's almost done.</p>

<p>"Here's your bloody wolf bait,"<br>
Cried the cook's familiar voice<br>
As he climbed the wagon wheel<br>
To watch the cowboys all rejoice.<br>
Then all thoughts were turned from reverence<br>
To a plate of beef and beans,<br>
As we graze on beef and biscuits<br>
Like yearlings on the range.</p>

<p>To the dickens with your city<br>
Where they herd the brainless brats,<br>
On a range so badly crowded<br>
There ain't room to cuss the cat.<br>
This life is not so sumptuous,<br>
I'm not longing for a change,<br>
For there is no place so homelike<br>
As a cow camp on the range.</p>


<p class="tit-song">FRECKLES. A FRAGMENT <span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>(p. 360)</span></p>

<p>He was little an' peaked an' thin, an' narry a no account horse,&mdash;<br>
Least that's the way you'd describe him in case that the beast had been lost;<br>
But, for single and double cussedness an' for double fired sin,<br>
The horse never came out o' Texas that was half-way knee-high to him!</p>

<p>The first time that ever I saw him was nineteen years ago last spring;<br>
'Twas the year we had grasshoppers, that come an' et up everything,<br>
That a feller rode up here one evenin' an' wanted to pen over night<br>
A small bunch of horses, he said; an' I told him I guessed 'twas all right.</p>

<p>Well, the feller was busted, the horses was thin, an' the grass round here kind of good,<br>
An' he said if I'd let him hold here a few days he'd settle with me when he could.<br>
So <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>(p. 361)</span> I told him all right, turn them loose down the draw, that the latch string was always untied,<br>
He was welcome to stop a few days if he wished and rest from his weary ride.</p>

<p>Well, the cuss stayed around for two or three weeks, till at last he was ready to go;<br>
And that cuss out yonder bein' too poor to move, he gimme,&mdash;the cuss had no dough.<br>
Well, at first the darn brute was as wild as a deer, an' would snort when he came to the branch,<br>
An' it took two cow punchers, on good horses, too, to handle him here at the ranch.</p>

<p>Well, the winter came on an' the range it got hard, an' my mustang commenced to get thin,<br>
So I fed him some an' rode him around, an' found out old Freckles was game.<br>
For that was what the other cuss called him,&mdash;just Freckles, no more or no less,&mdash;<br>
His color,&mdash;couldn't describe it,&mdash;something like a paint shop in distress.</p>

<p>Them was Indian times, young feller, that I am telling about;<br>
An' oft's the time I've seen the red man fight an' put the boys to rout.<br>
A good horse in them days, young feller, would save your life,&mdash;<br>
One that in any race could hold the pace when the red-skin bands were rife.</p>

<p>'Twas the end of round-up, the last day of June,<br>
Or maybe July, I don't remember,<br>
Or it might have been August, 'twas some time ago,<br>
Or perhaps 'twas the first of September.</p>

<p>Anyhow, 'twas the round-up we had at Mayou<br>
On the Lightning Rod's range, near Cayo;<br>
There were some twenty wagons, more or less, camped about<br>
On the temporal in the ca√±on.</p>

<p>First night we'd no cattle, so we only stood guard<br>
On the horses, somewhere near two hundred head;<br>
So we side-lined and hoppled, we belled and we staked,<br>
Loosed our hot-rolls and fell into bed.</p>

<p>Next morning 'bout day break we started our work,<br>
Our horses, like 'possums, felt fine.<br>
Each one "tendin' knittin'," none tryin' to shirk!<br>
So the round-up got on in good time.</p>

<p>Well, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>(p. 363)</span> we worked for a week till the country was clean<br>
And the bosses said, "Now, boys, we'll stay here.<br>
We'll carve and we'll trim 'em and start out a herd<br>
Up the east trail from old Abilene."</p>

<p>Next morning all on herd, and but two with the cut,<br>
And the boss on Piute, carving fine,<br>
Till he rode down his horse and had to pull out,<br>
And a new man went in to clean up.</p>

<p>Well, after each outfit had worked on the band<br>
There was only three head of them left;<br>
When Nig Add from L¬†F¬†D outfit rode in,&mdash;<br>
A dictionary on earmarks and brands.</p>

<p>He cut the two head out, told where they belonged;<br>
But when the last cow stood there alone<br>
Add's eyes bulged so he didn't know just what to say,<br>
'Ceptin', "Boss, dere's something here monstrous wrong!</p>

<p>"White folks smarter'n Add, and maybe I'se wrong;<br>
But here's six months' wages dat I'll give<br>
If anyone'll tell me when I reads dis mark<br>
To who dis longhorned cow belong!</p>

<p>Come all you melancholy folks wherever you may be,<br>
I'll sing you about the cowboy whose life is light and free.<br>
He roams about the prairie, and, at night when he lies down,<br>
His heart is as gay as the flowers in May in his bed upon the ground.</p>

<p>They're a little bit rough, I must confess, the most of them, at least;<br>
But if you do not hunt a quarrel you can live with them in peace;<br>
For if you do, you're sure to rue the day you joined their band.<br>
They will follow you up and shoot it out with you just man to man.</p>

<p>Did you ever go to a cowboy whenever hungry and dry,<br>
Asking for a dollar, and have him you deny?<br>
He'll just pull out his pocket book and hand you a note,&mdash;<br>
They are the fellows to help you whenever you are broke.</p>

<p>Go <span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>(p. 366)</span> to their ranches and stay a while, they never ask a cent;<br>
And when they go to town, their money is freely spent.<br>
They walk straight up and take a drink, paying for every one,<br>
And they never ask your pardon for anything they've done.</p>

<p>When they go to their dances, some dance while others pat<br>
They ride their bucking bronchos, and wear their broad-brimmed hats;<br>
With their California saddles, and their pants stuck in their boots,<br>
You can hear their spurs a-jingling, and perhaps some of them shoots.</p>

<p>Come all soft-hearted tenderfeet, if you want to have some fun;<br>
Go live among the cowboys, they'll show you how it's done.<br>
They'll treat you like a prince, my boys, about them there's nothing mean;<br>
But don't try to give them too much advice, for all of them ain't green.</p>


<p class="tit-song">BUCKING BRONCHO <span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367"></a>(p. 367)</span></p>

<p>My love is a rider, wild bronchos he breaks,<br>
Though he's promised to quit it, just for my sake.<br>
He ties up one foot, the saddle puts on,<br>
With a swing and a jump he is mounted and gone.</p>

<p>The first time I met him, 'twas early one spring,<br>
Riding a broncho, a high-headed thing.<br>
He tipped me a wink as he gaily did go;<br>
For he wished me to look at his bucking broncho.</p>

<p>The next time I saw him 'twas late in the fall,<br>
Swinging the girls at Tomlinson's ball.<br>
He laughed and he talked as we danced to and fro,<br>
Promised never to ride on another broncho.</p>

<p>He made me some presents, among them a ring;<br>
The return that I made him was a far better thing;<br>
'Twas a young maiden's heart, I'd have you all know;<br>
He's won it by riding his bucking broncho.</p>

<p>My love has a gun, and that gun he can use,<br>
But he's quit his gun fighting as well as his booze;<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368"></a>(p. 368)</span> he's sold him his saddle, his spurs, and his rope,<br>
And there's no more cow punching, and that's what I hope.</p>

<p>My love has a gun that has gone to the bad,<br>
Which makes poor old Jimmy feel pretty damn sad;<br>
For the gun it shoots high and the gun it shoots low,<br>
And it wobbles about like a bucking broncho.</p>

<p>Now all you young maidens, where'er you reside,<br>
Beware of the cowboy who swings the raw-hide;<br>
He'll court you and pet you and leave you and go<br>
In the spring up the trail on his bucking broncho.</p>

<p>Where the Pecos River winds and turns in its journey to the sea,<br>
From its white walls of sand and rock striving ever to be free,<br>
Near the highest railroad bridge that all these modern times have seen,<br>
Dwells fair young Patty Morehead, the Pecos River queen.</p>

<p>She is known by every cowboy on the Pecos River wide,<br>
They know full well that she can shoot, that she can rope and ride.<br>
She goes to every round-up, every cow work without fail,<br>
Looking out for her cattle, branded "walking hog on rail."</p>

<p>She made her start in cattle, yes, made it with her rope;<br>
Can tie down every maverick before it can strike a lope.<br>
She can rope and tie and brand it as quick as any man;<br>
She's voted by all cowboys an A-1 top cow hand.</p>

<p>Across <span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370"></a>(p. 370)</span> the Comstock railroad bridge, the highest in the West,<br>

Think a little horn of whiskey will help the thing along?<br>
It's all about the Top Hand, when he busted flat<br>
Bummin' round the town, in his Mexican hat.<br>
He's laid up all winter, and his pocket book is flat,<br>
His clothes are all tatters, but he don't mind that.</p>

<p>See him in town with a crowd that he knows,<br>
Rollin' cigarettes and smokin' through his nose.<br>
First thing he tells you, he owns a certain brand,&mdash;<br>
Leads you to think he is a daisy hand;<br>
Next thing he tells you 'bout his trip up the trail,<br>
All the way to Kansas, to finish out his tale.</p>

<p>Put him on a hoss, he's a handy hand to work;<br>
Put him in the brandin'-pen, he's dead sure to shirk.<br>
With his natural leaf tobacco in the pockets of his vest<br>
He'll tell you his California pants are the best.<br>
He's handled lots of cattle, hasn't any fears,<br>
Can draw his sixty dollars for the balance of his years.</p>

<p>Put him on herd, he's a-cussin' all day;<br>
Anything he tries, it's sure to get away.<br>
When <span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374"></a>(p. 374)</span> you have a round-up, he tells it all about<br>

<p>When he meets a greener he ain't afraid to rig,<br>
Stands him on a chuck box and makes him dance a jig,&mdash;<br>
Waves a loaded cutter, makes him sing and shout,&mdash;<br>
He's a regular Ben Thompson when the boss ain't about.<br>
When the boss ain't about he leaves his leggins in camp,<br>
He swears a man who wears them is worse than a tramp.</p>

<p>Says he's not carin' for the wages he earns,<br>
For Dad's rich in Texas,&mdash;got wagon loads to burn;<br>
But when he goes to town, he's sure to take it in,<br>
He's always been dreaded wherever he's been.<br>
He rides a fancy horse, he's a favorite man,<br>
Can get more credit than a common waddie can.</p>

<p>When you ship the cattle he's bound to go along<br>
To keep the boss from drinking and see that nothing's wrong.<br>
Wherever he goes, catch on to his name,<br>
He likes to be called with a handle to his name.<br>
He's always primping with a pocket looking-glass,<br>
From the top to the bottom he's a bold Jackass.</p>

With a herd of mules and steers.<br>
Now, bear in mind before you start,<br>
That you'll eat jerked beef, not ham,<br>
And antelope steak, Oh cuss the stuff!<br>
It often proves a sham.</p>

<p>You cannot find a stick of wood<br>
On all this prairie wide;<br>
Whene'er you eat you've got to stand<br>
Or sit on some old bull hide.<br>
It's fun to cook with buffalo chips<br>
Or mesquite, green as corn,&mdash;<br>
If I'd once known what I know now<br>
I'd have gone around Cape Horn.</p>

<p>The women have the hardest time<br>

They're sure to burn their hand.<br>
Then they scold their husbands round,<br>
Get mad and spill the tea,&mdash;<br>

Some will say they're content,<br>

<p>I came across a herd of deer and I trailed them through the snow,<br>
I trailed them to the mountains where straight up they did go.</p>

<p>I trailed them o'er the mountains, I trailed them to the brim,<br>
And I trailed them to the waters where they jumped in to swim.</p>

<p>I cocked both my pistols and under water went,&mdash;<br>
To kill the fattest of them deer, that was my whole intent.</p>

<p>While I was under water five hundred feet or more<br>
I fired both my pistols; like cannons did they roar.</p>

<p>I picked up my venison and out of water came,&mdash;<br>

<p>So <span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>(p. 380)</span> I bent my gun in circles and fired round a hill.<br>
And, out of three or four deer, ten thousand I did kill.</p>

<p>Then I picked up my venison and on my back I tied<br>
And as the sun came passing by I hopped up there to ride.</p>

<p>The sun she carried me o'er the globe, so merrily I did roam<br>
That in four and twenty hours I landed safe at home.</p>

<p>And the money I received for my venison and skin,<br>
I taken it all to the barn door and it would not all go in.</p>

Well, he hadn't found him yet.<br>
But the boys they knew of an old black steer,<br>
A sort of an old outlaw<br>
That ran down in the malpais<br>

<p>This old black steer had stood his ground<br>
With punchers from everywhere;<br>
So they bet old Bill at two to one<br>
That he couldn't quite get there.<br>

His withers and back were raw,<br>

His chaps and taps to boot,<br>

Bill swore he'd get the brute.<br>
Now, first Bill sort of sauntered round<br>
Old Blackie began to paw,<br>

Right round old Blackie's horns.<br>
The old gray hoss he stopped right still;<br>
The cinches broke like straw,<br>
And the old maguey and the Sam Stack tree<br>
Went driftin' down the draw.</p>

<p>Bill, he lit in a flint rock pile,<br>
His face and hands were scratched.<br>
He said he thought he could rope a snake<br>
But he guessed he'd met his match.<br>
He paid his bets like a little man<br>
Without a bit of jaw,<br>

And as it is short it won't take me long.<br>
There are some things of which I will speak<br>
Concerning the stage on the road to Cook's Peak.<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
Concerning the stage on the road to Cook's Peak.</p>

<p>It was in the morning at eight-forty-five,<br>
I was hooking up all ready to drive<br>
Out where the miners for minerals seek,<br>
With two little mules on the road to Cook's Peak&mdash;<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
With two little mules on the road to Cook's Peak.</p>

<p>With my two little mules I jog along<br>
And try to cheer them with ditty and song;<br>
O'er the wide prairie where coyotes sneak,<br>
While driving the stage on the road to Cook's Peak.<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
While driving the stage on the road to Cook's Peak.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have to haul heavy freight,<br>
Then it is I get home very late.<br>
In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page389" name="page389"></a>(p. 389)</span> rain or shine, six days in the week,<br>
'Tis the same little mules on the road to Cook's Peak.<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
'Tis the same little mules on the road to Cook's Peak.</p>

<p>And when with the driving of stage I am through<br>
I will to my two little mules bid adieu.<br>
And hope that those creatures, so gentle and meek,<br>
Will have a good friend on the road to Cook's Peak.<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
Will have a good friend on the road to Cook's Peak.</p>

<p>Now all kind friends that travel about,<br>
Come take a trip on the Wallis stage route.<br>
With a plenty of grit, they never get weak,&mdash;<br>
Those two little mules on the road to Cook's Peak.<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
On the road to Cook's Peak,&mdash;<br>
Those two little mules on the road to Cook's Peak.</p>


<p class="tit-song">ARAPHOE, OR BUCKSKIN JOE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390"></a>(p. 390)</span></p>

<p>'Twas a calm and peaceful evening in a camp called Araphoe,<br>
And the whiskey was a running with a soft and gentle flow,<br>
The music was a-ringing in a dance hall cross the way,<br>
And the dancers was a-swinging just as close as they could lay.</p>

<p>People gathered round the tables, a-betting with their wealth,<br>
And near by stood a stranger who had come there for his health.<br>
He was a peaceful little stranger though he seemed to be unstrung;<br>
For just before he'd left his home he'd separated with one lung.</p>

<p>Nearby at a table sat a man named Hankey Dean,<br>
A tougher man says Hankey, buckskin chaps had never seen.<br>
But Hankey was a gambler and he was plum sure to lose;<br>
For he had just departed with a sun-dried stack of blues.</p>

<p>He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391"></a>(p. 391)</span> rose from the table, on the floor his last chip flung,<br>
And cast his fiery glimmers on the man with just one lung.<br>
"No wonder I've been losing every bet I made tonight<br>
When a sucker and a tenderfoot was between me and the light.</p>

<p>Look here, little stranger, do you know who I am?"<br>
"Yes, and I don't care a copper colored damn."<br>
The dealers stopped their dealing and the players held their breath;<br>
For words like those to Hankey were a sudden flirt with death.</p>

<p>"Listen, gentle stranger, I'll read my pedigree:<br>
I'm known on handling tenderfeet and worser men than thee;<br>
The lions on the mountains, I've drove them to their lairs;<br>
The wild-cats are my playmates, and I've wrestled grizzly bears;</p>

<p>"Why, the centipedes can't mar my tough old hide,<br>
And rattle snakes have bit me and crawled off and died.<br>
I'm as wild as the horse that roams the range;<br>
The moss grows on my teeth and wild blood flows through my veins.</p>

<p>"I'm <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392"></a>(p. 392)</span> wild and woolly and full of fleas<br>
And never curried below the knees.<br>
Now, little stranger, if you'll give me your address,&mdash;<br>
How would you like to go, by fast mail or express?"</p>

<p>The little stranger who was leaning on the door<br>
Picked up a hand of playing cards that were scattered on the floor.<br>
Picking out the five of spades, he pinned it to the door<br>
And then stepped back some twenty paces or more.</p>

<p>He pulled out his life-preserver, and with a "one, two, three, four,"<br>
Blotted out a spot with every shot;<br>
For he had traveled with a circus and was a fancy pistol shot.<br>
"I have one more left, kind sir, if you wish to call the play."</p>

<p>Then Hanke stepped up to the stranger and made a neat apology,<br>
"Why, the lions in the mountains,&mdash;that was nothing but a joke.<br>
Never mind about the extra, you are a bad shooting man,<br>
And I'm a meek little child and as harmless as a lamb."</p>


<p class="tit-song">ROUNDED UP IN GLORY <span class="pagenum"><a id="page393" name="page393"></a>(p. 393)</span></p>

<p>I have been thinking to-day,<br>
As my thoughts began to stray,<br>
Of your memory to me worth more than gold.<br>
As you ride across the plain,<br>
'Mid the sunshine and the rain,&mdash;<br>
You will be rounded up in glory bye and bye.</p>

    <p class="add2em">Chorus:<br>
    You will be rounded up in glory bye and bye,<br>
    You will be rounded up in glory bye and bye,<br>
    When the milling time is o'er<br>
    And you will stampede no more,<br>
    When he rounds you up within the Master's fold.</p>

<p>As you ride across the plain<br>
With the cowboys that have fame,<br>
And the storms and the lightning flash by.<br>
We shall meet to part no more<br>
Upon the golden shore<br>
When he rounds us up in glory bye and bye.</p>

<p>May we lift our voices high<br>
To that sweet bye and bye,<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394"></a>(p. 394)</span> be known by the brand of the Lord;<br>
For his property we are,<br>
And he will know us from afar<br>
When he rounds us up in glory bye and bye.</p>


<p class="tit-song">THE DRUNKARD'S HELL <span class="pagenum"><a id="page395" name="page395"></a>(p. 395)</span></p>

<p>It was on a cold and stormy night<br>
I saw and heard an awful sight;<br>
The lightning flashed and thunder rolled<br>
Around my poor benighted soul.</p>

<p>I thought I heard a mournful sound<br>
Among the groans still lower down,<br>
That awful sight no tongue can tell<br>
Is this,&mdash;the place called Drunkard's Hell.</p>

<p>I thought I saw the gulf below<br>
Where all the dying drunkards go.<br>
I raised my hand and sad to tell<br>
It was the place called Drunkard's Hell.</p>

<p>I traveled on and got there at last<br>
And started to take a social glass;<br>
But every time I started,&mdash;well,<br>
I thought about the Drunkard's Hell.</p>

<p>I dashed it down to leave that place<br>
And started to seek redeeming grace.<br>
I felt like Paul, at once I'd pray<br>
Till all my sins were washed away.</p>

<p>I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page396" name="page396"></a>(p. 396)</span> then went home to change my life<br>
And see my long neglected wife.<br>
I found her weeping o'er the bed<br>
Because her infant babe was dead.</p>

<p>I told her not to mourn and weep<br>
Because her babe had gone to sleep;<br>
Its happy soul had fled away<br>
To dwell with Christ till endless day.</p>

<p>I taken her by her pale white hand,<br>
She was so weak she could not stand;<br>
I laid her down and breathed a prayer<br>
That God might bless and save her there.</p>

<p>I then went to the Temperance hall<br>
And taken a pledge among them all.<br>
They taken me in with a willing hand<br>
And taken me in as a temperance man.</p>

<p>So seven long years have passed away<br>
Since first I bowed my knees to pray;<br>
So now I live a sober life<br>
With a happy home and a loving wife.</p>

<p>I am a wild and roving lad,<br>
A wild and rambling lad I'll be;<br>
For I do love a little girl<br>
And she does love me.</p>

<p>"O Willie, O Willie, I love you so,<br>
I love you more than I do know;<br>
And if my tongue could tell you so<br>
I'd give the world to let you know."</p>

<p>When Julia's old father came this to know,&mdash;<br>
That Julia and Willie were loving so,&mdash;<br>
He ripped and swore among them all,<br>
And swore he'd use a cannon ball.</p>

<p>She wrote Willie a letter with her right hand<br>
And sent it to him in the western land.<br>
"Oh, read these lines, sweet William dear.<br>
For this is the last of me you will hear."</p>

<p>He read those lines while he wept and cried,<br>
"Ten thousand times I wish I had died",<br>
He read those lines while he wept and said,<br>
"Ten thousand times I wish I were dead."</p>

<p>When <span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398"></a>(p. 398)</span> her old father came home that night<br>
He called for Julia, his heart's delight,<br>
He ran up stairs and her door he broke<br>
And found her hanging by her own bed rope.</p>

<p>And with his knife he cut her down,<br>
And in her bosom this note he found<br>
Saying, "Dig my grave both deep and wide<br>
And bury sweet Willie by my side."</p>

<p>They dug her grave both deep and wide<br>
And buried sweet Willie by her side;<br>
And on her grave set a turtle dove<br>
To show the world they died for love.</p>


<p class="tit-song">BRIGHAM YOUNG. I. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399"></a>(p. 399)</span></p>

<p>I'll sing you a song that has often been sung<br>
About an old Mormon they called Brigham Young.<br>
Of wives he had many who were strong in the lungs,<br>
Which Brigham found out by the length of their tongues.<br>
Ri tu ral, lol, lu ral.</p>

<p>Oh, sad was the life of a Mormon to lead,<br>
Yet Brigham adhered all his life to his creed.<br>
He said 'twas such fun, and true, without doubt,<br>
To see the young wives knock the old ones about.<br>
Ri tu ral, lol, lu ral.</p>

<p>One day as old Brigham sat down to his dinner<br>
He saw a young wife who was not getting thinner;<br>
When the elders cried out, one after the other,<br>
By the holy, she wants to go home to her mother.<br>
Ri tu ral, lol, lu ral.</p>

<p>Old Brigham replied, which can't be denied,<br>
He couldn't afford to lose such a bride.<br>
Then do not be jealous but banish your fears;<br>
For the tree is well known by the fruit that it bears.<br>
Ri tu ral, lol, lu ral.</p>

<p>That <span class="pagenum"><a id="page400" name="page400"></a>(p. 400)</span> I love one and all you very well know,<br>
Then do not provoke me or my anger will show.<br>
What must be our fate if found here in a row,<br>
If Uncle Sam comes with his row-de-dow-dow.<br>
Ri tu ral, lol, lu ral.</p>

<p>Then cease all your quarrels and do not despair,<br>
To meet Uncle Sam I will quickly prepare.<br>
Hark! I hear Yankee Doodle played over the hills!<br>
Ah! here's the enemy with their powder and pills.<br>
Ri tu ral, lol, lu ral.</p>


<p class="tit-song">BRIGHAM YOUNG. II. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page401" name="page401"></a>(p. 401)</span></p>

<p>Now Brigham Young is a Mormon bold,<br>
And a leader of the roaring rams,<br>
And shepherd of a lot of fine tub sheep<br>
And a lot of pretty little lambs.<br>
Oh, he lives with his five and forty wives,<br>
In the city of the Great Salt Lake,<br>
Where they breed and swarm like hens on a farm<br>
And cackle like ducks to a drake.</p>

    <p class="add1em"><span class="add1em">Chorus:&mdash;</span><br>
  Oh Brigham, Brigham Young,<br>
  It's a miracle how you survive,<br>
  With your roaring rams and your pretty little lambs<br>
  And your five and forty wives.</p>

<p>Number forty-five is about sixteen,<br>
Number one is sixty and three;<br>
And they make such a riot, how he keeps them quiet<br>
Is a downright mystery to me.<br>
For they clatter and they chaw and they jaw, jaw, jaw,<br>
And each has a different desire;<br>
It would aid the renown of the best shop in town<br>
To supply them with half they desire.</p>

<p>Now, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page402" name="page402"></a>(p. 402)</span> Brigham Young was a stout man once,<br>
And now he is thin and old;<br>
And I am sorry to state he is bald on the pate,<br>
Which once had a covering of gold.<br>
For his oldest wives won't have white wool,<br>
And his young ones won't have red,<br>
So, with tearing it out, and taking turn about,<br>
They have torn all the hair off his head.</p>

<p>Now, the oldest wives sing songs all day,<br>
And the young ones all sing songs;<br>
And amongst such a crowd he has it pretty loud,&mdash;<br>
They're as noisy as Chinese gongs.<br>
And when they advance for a Mormon dance<br>
He is filled with the direst alarms;<br>
For they are sure to end the night in a tabernacle fight<br>
To see who has the fairest charms.</p>

<p>Now, if any man here envies Brigham Young<br>
Let him go to the Great Salt Lake;<br>
And if he has the leisure to enjoy his pleasure,<br>
He'll find it a great mistake.<br>
One wife at a time, so says my rhyme,<br>
Is enough,&mdash;there's no denial;&mdash;<br>
So, before you strive to be lord of forty-five,<br>
Take two for a month on trial.</p>

<p>I am an old man some sixty years old<br>

But when I was a young man ten years old<br>
They made a stable boy of me.</p>

That made the fastest time,<br>
But I never saw one in all my life<br>
Like that old gray mule of mine.</p>

<p>On a Sunday morn I dress myself,<br>
A-goin' out to ride;<br>
Now, my old mule is as gray as a bird,<br>
Then he is full of his pride.</p>

<p>He never runs away with you,<br>
Never cuts up any shine;<br>
For the only friend I have on earth<br>
Is this old gray mule of mine.</p>

<p>Now my old gray mule is dead and gone,<br>
Gone to join the heavenly band,<br>
With silver shoes upon his feet<br>
To dance on the golden strand.</p>

<p>When gold was found in forty-eight the people thought 'twas gas,<br>
And some were fools enough to think the lumps were only brass.<br>
But soon they all were satisfied and started off to mine;<br>
They bought their ships, came round the Horn, in the days of forty-nine.</p>

  <p class="add1em">Refrain:<br>
  Then they thought of what they'd been told<br>
  When they started after gold,&mdash;<br>
  That they never in the world would make a pile.</p>

<p>The people all were crazy then, they didn't know what to do.<br>
They sold their farms for just enough to pay their passage through.<br>
They bid their friends a long farewell, said, "Dear wife, don't you cry,<br>
I'll send you home the yellow lumps a piano for to buy."</p>

<p>The poor, the old, and the rotten scows were advertised to sail<br>
From <span class="pagenum"><a id="page405" name="page405"></a>(p. 405)</span> New Orleans with passengers, but they must pump and bail.<br>
The ships were crowded more than full, and some hung on behind,<br>
And others dived off from the wharf and swam till they were blind.</p>

<p>With rusty pork and stinking beef and rotten, wormy bread!<br>
The captains, too, that never were up as high as the main mast head!<br>
The steerage passengers would rave and swear that they'd paid their passage<br>
And wanted something more to eat beside bologna sausage.</p>

<p>They then began to cross the plain with oxen, hollowing "haw."<br>
And steamers then began to run as far as Panama.<br>
And there for months the people staid, that started after gold,<br>
And some returned disgusted with the lies that had been told.</p>

<p>The people died on every route, they sickened and died like sheep;<br>
And those at sea before they died were launched into the deep;<br>
And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>(p. 406)</span> those that died while crossing the plains fared not so well as that,<br>
For a hole was dug and they thrown in along the miserable Platte.</p>

<p>The ships at last began to arrive and the people began to inquire.<br>
They say that flour is a dollar a pound, do you think it will be any higher?<br>
And to carry their blankets and sleep outdoors, it seemed so very droll!<br>
Both tired and mad, without a cent, they damned the lousy hole.</p>

them to music.<a href="#footnotetag5">(Back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 6:</b> These verses are used in many parts of the West as a dance
song. Sung to waltz music the song takes the place of "Home,
Sweet Home" at the conclusion of a cowboy ball. The "fiddle"
is silenced and the entire company sing as they dance.<a href="#footnotetag6">(Back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 8:</b> This poem, one of the best in Larry Chittenden's <i>Ranch
Verses</i>, published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, has been set
to music by the cowboys and its phraseology slightly changed, as
this copy will show, by oral transmission. I have heard it in
New Mexico and it has been sent to me from various places,&mdash;always
as a song. None of those who sent in the song knew
that it was already in print.<a href="#footnotetag8">(Back)</a></p>
